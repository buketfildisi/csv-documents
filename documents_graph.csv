2020 xito that end, authorities across the globe have already implemented wide-ranging policies. the april 2020 fiscal monitor describes the fiscal support packages that have been announced by governments across the globe. large, timely, temporary, and targeted fiscal measures are necessary to ensure that a temporary shutdown of activity does not lead to more permanent damage to the productive capacity of the economy and to society as a whole. central banks globally have taken bold and decisive actions by easing monetary policy, purchasing a range of assets, and providing liquidity to the financial system in an effort to lean against the tightening in financial conditions and maintain the flow of credit to the economy. as policy rates are now near or below zero in many major advanced economies, unconventional measures and forward guidance about the expected policy path are becoming the main tools for these central banks going forward. central banks may also consider further measures to support the economy during these challenging times. policymakers need to maintain a balance between safeguarding financial stability and supporting economic activity. banks. in the first instance, banks’ existing capital and liquidity buffers should be used to absorb losses and funding pressures. in cases where the impact is sizable or longer lasting and bank capital adequacy is affected, supervisors should take targeted actions, including asking banks to submit credible capital restoration plans. authorities may also need to step in with fiscal support—either direct subsidies or tax relief—to help borrowers to repay their loans and finance their operations, or provide credit guarantees to banks. supervisors should also encourage banks to negotiate, in a prudent manner, temporary adjustments to loan terms for companies and households struggling to service their debts. asset managers. to prudently manage liquidity risks associated with large outflows, regulators should encourage fund managers to make full use of the available liquidity tools where it would be in the interests of unit holders to do so. financial markets. market resilience should be promoted through well-calibrated, clearly defined, and appropriately communicated measures, such as circuit breakers. many emerging market economies are already facing volatile market conditions and should manage these pressures through exchange rate flexibility, where feasible. for countries with adequate reserves, exchange rate intervention can lean against market illiquidity and thus play a role in muting excessive volatility. however, interventions should not prevent necessary adjustments in the exchange rate. in the face of an imminent crisis, capital flow management measures could be part of a broad policy package, but they cannot substitute for warranted macroeconomic adjustment. sovereign debt managers should prepare for longer-term funding disruptions by putting contingency plans in place to deal with limited access to external financing. multilateral cooperation is essential to help reduce the intensity of the covid-19 shock and its damage to the global economy and financial system. countries confronting the twin crises of health and external funding shocks—for example, those reliant on external financing or commodity exporters dealing with the plunge in commodity prices—may additionally need bilateral or multilateral assistance to ensure that health spending is not compromised in their difficult adjustment process. official bilateral creditors have been called upon by the imf managing director and the world bank president to suspend debt payments from countries below the international development association’s operational threshold that request forbearance while they battle the pandemic. the imf , with $1 trillion in available resources, is actively supporting member countries.",structured

efficient. however, crypto assets have been afflicted by fraud, security breaches, and operational failures, and have been associated with illicit activities. at present, crypto assets do not appear to pose financial stability risks, but they could do so should their use become more widespread without appropriate safeguards.chapter 2 takes a comprehensive look at the evolu-tion of the riskiness of corporate credit allocation, given concerns that the continued search for higher yield may have led banks and investors to extend too much credit to risky borrowers. the chapter docu-ments a pattern in which the firms obtaining more credit are relatively riskier during periods of strong credit expansion, especially when lending standards are loose or financial conditions are easy. an increase in the riskiness of credit allocation signals heightened downside risks to gdp growth and a higher prob-ability of banking stress, in addition to the previously documented signals provided by credit growth. coun-try authorities can use the measures introduced in this chapter to monitor the buildup of vulnerabilities via risk taking in credit allocation. the chapter discusses policies that can mitigate the increase in credit riski-ness during credit expansions. chapter 3 documents a striking increase in house price synchronization among 40 countries and 44 major cities in advanced and emerging market econo-mies over the past several decades. the exposure of countries and cities to global financial conditions may help explain that increase. rising housing valuations since the global financial crisis raise the specter of a simultaneous decline in house prices should financial conditions reverse. the chapter suggests that height-ened synchronicity of house prices can signal a higher probability of adverse scenarios for the real economy, especially when credit is high or rapidly expanding.

remain. negative yields and flatter yield curves—along with a more subdued growth outlook—have reduced expectations of bank profitability, and the market capitalization of some banks has fallen to low levels. banks are also exposed to sectors with high vulner-abilities through their lending activities, leaving them susceptible to potential losses. in china, the authorities had to intervene in three regional banks. among non-us banks, us dollar funding fragilities—which were a cause of significant stress during the global financial crisis—remain a source of vulnerability in many econo-mies, as discussed in chapter 5. this dollar funding fragility could amplify the impact of a tightening in funding conditions and could create spillovers to coun-tries that borrow in us dollars from non-us banks.environmental, social, and governance (esg) principles are becoming increasingly important for borrowers and investors. esg factors could have a material impact on corporate performance and may give rise to financial stability risks, particularly through climate-related losses. authorities have a key role to play in developing standards for esg invest-ing. this role, along with the need to close data gaps and encourage more consistent reporting, is discussed in chapter 6.against the backdrop of easy financial conditions, stretched valuations in some markets, and elevated vulnerabilities, medium-term risks to global growth and financial stability continue to be firmly skewed to the downside. macroeconomic and macroprudential poli-cies should be tailored to the particular circumstances facing each economy. in countries where economic activity remains robust but vulnerabilities are high or rising amid still easy financial conditions, policymak-ers should urgently tighten macroprudential policies, including broad-based macroprudential tools (such as the countercyclical capital buffer). in economies where macroeconomic policies are being eased in response to a deterioration in the economic outlook, but where vulnerabilities in particular sectors are still a concern, policymakers may have to use a more targeted approach to address specific pockets of vulnerability. for economies facing a significant slowdown, the focus should be on more accommodative policies, consider-ing available policy space.policymakers urgently need to take action to tackle financial vulnerabilities that could exacerbate the next economic downturn:• rising corporate debt burdens: stringent supervision of bank credit risk assessment and lending practices should be maintained. efforts should be made to increase disclosure and transparency in nonbank finance markets to enable a more comprehensive assessment of risks. in economies where overall corporate sector debt is deemed to be systemically high, in addition to sector-specific prudential tools for banks, policymakers may consider developing prudential tools for highly leveraged firms. reducing the bias in tax systems that favors debt over equity financing would also help reduce incentives for excessive borrowing.• increasing holdings of riskier and more illiquid securities by institutional investors: the oversight of nonbank financial entities should be strengthened. vulnerabilities among institutional investors can be addressed through appropriate incentives (for example, to reduce the offering of guaranteed return products), minimum solvency and liquidity stan-dards, and enhanced disclosure.• increased reliance on external borrowing by emerging and frontier market economies: indebted emerging market and frontier economies should mitigate debt sustainability risks through prudent debt man-agement practices and strong debt management frameworks.global policy coordination remains critical. there is a need to resolve trade tensions, as discussed in the april 2019 world economic outlook. policymakers should also complete and fully implement the global regulatory reform agenda, ensuring that there is no rollback of regulatory standards. continued interna-tional coordination and collaboration is also needed to ensure a smooth transition from libor to new reference rates for a wide range of financial contracts around the world by the end of 2021.']",structured

existing biases in credit allocation. mean-while, china’s importance for other emerging markets will continue to increase with its inclusion in bench-mark indices; portfolio flows to china are expected to rise by as much as $150 billion by 2020 as a result of its inclusion in a global bond index. • volatile portfolio flows to emerging markets: portfolio flows to emerging markets are increasingly influ-enced by benchmark-driven investors. the amount of funds benchmarked against widely followed emerging market bond indices has quadrupled in the past 10 years to $800 billion. estimates also suggest that 70 percent of country allocations of investment funds are influenced by benchmark indi-x international monetary fund | april 2019global financial stability report: vulnerabilities in a maturing credit cycleces. given that benchmark-driven investors are more sensitive to changes in global financial conditions than other investors, the benefits of index member-ship may be tempered by financial stability risks for some countries. as these investors become a larger share of portfolio flows, external shocks may propa-gate to medium-size emerging and frontier market economies faster than in the past. • house prices at risk (har): the recent rapid increase in house prices in many countries has raised con-cerns about the possibility of a price correction. a new house prices-at-risk framework, presented in chapter 2 of this report, is used to quantify downside risks to house price growth. lower house price momentum, overvaluation, excessive credit growth, and tighter financial conditions help predict downside risks to house prices up to three years ahead. in turn, the measure of house prices at risk helps forecast downside risks to gdp growth and predict financial crises. the most recent data point to increased downside risks to house prices over the next one to three years in some countries.looking ahead, there is a risk that positive investor sentiment could deteriorate abruptly, leading to a sharp tightening of financial conditions. this will have a larger effect on economies with weaker fundamentals, greater financial vulnerabilities, and less policy space to respond to shocks. possible triggers include the following: • a sharper-than-expected growth slowdown could lead to tighter financial conditions as risk asset prices fall, reflecting a weaker outlook for corporate earnings, even as policies turn more accommodative. • an unexpected shift to a less dovish outlook for mon-etary policy in advanced economies could trigger a repricing in markets, especially if investors realize that they have taken too benign a view on the mon-etary policy stance. • political and policy risks, such as an escalation of trade tensions or a no-deal brexit, could affect mar-ket sentiment and lead to a spike in risk aversion. amid rising downside risks to global growth, policy-makers should aim to avoid a sharper economic slow-down, while keeping financial vulnerabilities in check: • policymakers should clearly communicate any reassessment of the monetary policy stance that reflects either changes in the economic outlook or risks surrounding the outlook. this will help avoid unnecessary swings in financial markets or unduly compressed market volatility. • in countries with high or rising financial vulner-abilities, policymakers should proactively deploy prudential tools or expand their macroprudential toolkits where needed. these countries would benefit from activating or tightening broad-based macro-prudential measures, such as countercyclical capital buffers, to increase the financial system’s resilience. efforts should also focus on developing prudential tools to address rising corporate debt from nonbank financial intermediaries and maturity and liquid-ity mismatches in the nonbank sector. regulators should also ensure that more comprehensive stress tests (that include macro-financial feedback effects) are conducted for banks and nonbank lenders. • measures to repair public and private balance sheets should be stepped up. a gradual fiscal adjustment is needed to reduce elevated risks, based on policies that will support medium-term growth. efforts to tackle nonperforming loans on euro area bank bal-ance sheets should continue. given concerns about the sovereign–financial sector nexus, consideration could be given to mitigating concentration risk in banks’ sovereign exposures.• emerging market economies should ensure resilience against foreign portfolio outflows by reducing excessive external liabilities, cutting reliance on short-term debt, and maintaining adequate fiscal and foreign exchange reserve buffers. given the rising impor-tance of benchmark-driven portfolio flows, a close dialogue is needed between index providers, the investment community, and regulators. building on the progress achieved so far, the chinese authori-ties should continue financial sector de-risking and deleveraging policies and put greater emphasis on addressing bank vulnerabilities. structural reforms such as reducing the emphasis on growth targets and tightening budget constraints for chinese state-owned enterprises will be critical to reduce credit misallocation.']",structured

fund | october 2018global financial stability report—a decade after the global financial crisis: are we safer?percent of their combined gdp). banks have increased their capital and liquidity buffers since the crisis, but they remain exposed to highly indebted companies, households, and sovereigns; to their holdings of opaque and illiquid assets; or to their use of foreign currency funding. external borrowing has continued to rise in most emerging market economies. this poses challenges for countries that are facing external financing risks and trade shocks, but that lack adequate reserve buffers or strong domestic investor bases to cushion the impact of external shocks. given the challenging external environ-ment, policymakers in emerging market economies should be prepared for further capital outflow pressures. in addition to the analysis of the key risks to global financial stability, this report takes stock of the global regulatory reform agenda over the past decade and looks at whether the global financial ecosystem since the crisis has evolved in the intended direction: that is, toward greater safety.on the positive side, the broad regulatory agenda set by the international community has helped strengthen the global banking system. some of the pernicious forms of shadow banking that developed in the run-up to the crisis have been curtailed, and most countries now have a macroprudential authority and some tools with which to oversee and contain risks to the financial system. however, a number of factors may have led to some fragmentation in funding and market liquidity. regulators are increasingly focusing on the liquidity of individual entities within international banking groups. there are benefits to greater ring-fencing of liquid-ity, particularly in the context of resolution during stress periods, but there is a risk that doing so could fragment liquidity in international banking groups. in capital markets, market liquidity appears to have become more segmented, for example, across different trading platforms. while there is no clear evidence of a broad-based deterioration in market liquidity, careful monitoring of liquidity conditions is warranted.to further improve the resilience of the global financial system, the financial regulatory reform agenda should be completed, and a rollback of reforms should be avoided. to adequately address potential systemic risks, financial regulation and supervision should be used more proactively. broad-based macroprudential tools, including countercyclical capital buffers, should be used more actively in coun-tries where financial conditions remain accommoda-tive and where vulnerabilities are high. furthermore, financial stability requires new macroprudential tools for addressing vulnerabilities outside the banking sector. finally, regulators and supervisors must remain attentive to new risks, including possible threats to financial stability stemming from cybersecurity, finan-cial technology, and other institutions or activities outside the perimeter of prudential regulation.']",structured

fundindustries.directors welcomed the conclusion of thestaff’s analysis that the reallocation of creditrisk to the insurance sector, together withimprovements in risk management in the sec-tor, appears to have contributed to enhancedoverall financial stability. moreover, by allocat-ing a greater share of their portfolio to creditinstruments, many life insurers avail them-selves of a more predictable return. while theinvestment in credit instruments by insurersdeserves to be supported, directors stressedthat this will need to go hand in hand withcontinued efforts to improve risk manage-ment and regulatory oversight of the sector.areas for improvement highlighted bydirectors include: wider implementation ofrisk-based capital standards by regulators;enhancement of supervisory resources inmany mature market jurisdictions; increasedinformation sharing among supervisors; andstrengthened disclosure requirements.directors welcomed the current debate oninternational accounting standards for insur-ers, and looked forward to the developmentof converging standards that provide an accu-rate reflection of insurance companies’ finan-cial position. to be adequate, disclosureshould be comprehensive, and include infor-mation on sensitivities and risks. while ratingagencies play a helpful role in disseminatinginformation on risks, directors cautioned thatthey should not be relied upon as a substitutefor appropriate supervision.institutional investors inemerging marketsdirectors welcomed the discussion of theinstitutional investor base for claims on emerg-ing markets. they saw the development of astable investor base as a key element in reduc-ing the volatility of capital flows to emergingmarkets. while ongoing changes are con-tributing to a welcome broadening and diver-sification of the investor base, directorsobserved that the decline in dedicated, rela-tive to crossover, investors may also haveincreased the volatility of capital flows.another source of potential volatility arisesfrom the impact that even small changes inthe portfolio positions of institutionalinvestors can have on emerging markets, giventhe large size of the assets under managementof these investors. directors agreed that thefactors influencing the changing nature of theinvestor base, as well as their policy implica-tions—including for debt management poli-cies and practices in emerging markets—willrequire continued careful analysis. theyemphasized the importance of adequate trans-parency and disclosure regarding both govern-ment policies and corporate developments,with investor relations programs being a par-ticularly useful instrument. in addition, thedevelopment of an efficient market infrastruc-ture within emerging markets will be helpfulin attracting institutional investors from bothmature and domestic markets.directors also commented on the supervi-sory and regulatory implications of theexpanding portfolios of nonbank institutionalinvestors in emerging markets, in particularthe rapid growth of pension funds. theynoted that, in view of the growing imbalancebetween the assets under management ofthese funds and the available securities, closecoordination will be required betweenchanges in the regulatory framework, thedevelopment of local capital markets, and thegradual easing of limits on foreign invest-ments by pension funds to increase theiropportunities for portfolio diversification.directors viewed the development of localsecurities markets as key to ensuring properrisk management by the insurance industry. inview of the rapid growth and increasingsophistication of the activities of local institu-tional investors involved in both local andinternational markets, it will also be importantto persevere with strong efforts to enhancethe risk management skills of both investorsand regulators.annex summing up by the acting chair160']",structured

in the financial markets and that theyhave access to full and accurate informationon the health of publicly traded firms. thecontinuation of ongoing efforts to improvecorporate governance, accounting,

against changing globalfinancial conditions.measures to promote localsecurities marketsdirectors welcomed the discussion in thegfsr of key policy issues related to the rolethat local securities and derivatives marketscan play in strengthening the emerging mar-kets’ capacity to better weather global financialvolatility. they noted that these markets canprovide an additional and possibly more stablesource of funding for domestic corporationsand the public sector, and stimulate domesticsavings by broadening the set of investmentopportunities. among the core policies to pro-mote the development and ensure the smoothfunctioning of local securities markets,directors highlighted measures to improvemarket infrastructure and transparency,strengthen corporate governance, develop liq-uid benchmarks, and promote a domesticinstitutional investor base. a few directorsnoted the supportive role that foreign directinvestment in the financial sector can play inthis regard. directors stressed that steps todevelop local securities markets need carefulsequencing, with the development of moneymarkets typically being a crucial first step indeveloping bond and derivatives markets. inthis connection, a suggestion was also madethat country case studies could help guide thedevelopment of local securities markets.directors cautioned against heavy resort tobonds indexed to foreign currencies, whichcould increase vulnerability to external shocksand contribute to unstable debt structures.however, inflation-indexed bonds can be auseful instrument to deepen local bond mar-kets. while local derivatives markets can facili-tate the management of financial risk,directors stressed that the development ofsuch markets needs to be based on a strongsupervisory and regulatory foundation.although local securities and derivativesmarkets have grown substantially over the lastyears, directors observed that they have notyet developed enough to provide full insur-ance against

domestic imbalances and lower growth, as noted in the october 2015 world economic outlook (weo). many emerging market economies relied on rapid credit creation to sidestep the worst impacts of the global crisis. this increased borrowing has resulted in sharply higher leverage of the private sector in many economies, par-ticularly in cyclical sectors, accompanied by rising foreign currency

backdrop, the global financial outlook is clouded by a triad of broad policy challenges in evidence over the past several months: x international monetary fund | october 2015global financial stability report: vulnerabilities, legacies, and policy challenges: risks rotating to emerging markets• emerging market vulnerabilities—as examined in the weo, growth in emerging markets and developing economies is projected to decline for the fifth year in a row. many emerging markets have increased their resilience to external shocks with increased exchange rate flexibility, higher foreign exchange reserves, increased reliance on fdi flows and domestic-currency external financing, and generally stronger policy frameworks. but balance sheets have become stretched thinner in many emerging market com-panies and banks. these firms have become more susceptible to financial stress, economic downturn, and capital outflows. deteriorating corporate health runs the risk of deepening the sovereign-corporate and the corporate-bank nexus in some key emerging markets. china in particular faces a delicate bal-ance of transitioning to more consumption-driven growth without activity slowing too much, while reducing financial vulnerabilities and moving toward a more market-based system—a challenging set of objectives. recent market developments, including slumping commodity prices, china’s bursting equity and margin-lending bubble, falling emerging market equities, and pressure on exchange rates, underscore these challenges. • legacy issues from the crisis in advanced economies—high public and private debt in advanced economies and remaining gaps in the euro area architecture need to be addressed to consolidate financial stabil-ity, and avoid political tensions and headwinds to confidence and growth. in the euro area, addressing remaining sovereign and banking vulnerabilities is still a challenge. • weak systemic market liquidity—this poses a chal-lenge in adjusting to new equilibria in markets and the wider economy. extraordinarily accommodative policies have contributed to a compression of risk pre-miums across a range of markets including sovereign bonds and corporate credit, as well as a compression of liquidity and equity risk premiums. while recent market developments have unwound some of this compression, risk premiums could still rise further. now that the federal reserve looks set to begin the gradual process of tightening monetary policy, the global financial system faces an unprecedented adjust-ment as risk premiums “normalize” from historically low levels alongside rising policy rates and a modest cyclical recovery. abnormal market conditions will need to adjust smoothly to the new environment. but there are risks from a rapid decompression, particu-larly given what appears to be more brittle market structures and market fragilities concentrated in credit intermediation channels, which could come to the fore as financial conditions normalize (see chapter 2). indeed, recent episodes of high market volatility and liquidity dislocations across advanced and emerging market asset classes highlight this challenge.strong policy actions are needed to ensure “successful normalization”the relatively weak baseline for both financial stabil-ity and the economic outlook leaves risks tilted to the downside. thus, ensuring successful normalization of financial and monetary conditions and a smooth handover to higher growth requires further policy efforts to tackle pressing challenges. these should include the following: • continued effort by the federal reserve to provide clear and consistent communication, enabling the smooth absorption of rising u.s. rates, which is essential for global financial health. • in the euro area, more progress in strengthening the financial architecture of the common currency to bolster market and business confidence. addressing the overhang of private debt and bank nonperform-ing loans in the euro area would support bank finance and corporate health, and boost investment. • rebalancing and gradual deleveraging in china, which will require great care and strong commit-ments to market-based reforms and further strength-ening of the financial system. • more broadly, addressing both cyclical and structural challenges in emerging markets, which will be criti-cal to underpin improved prospects and resilience. authorities in emerging markets should regularly monitor corporate foreign currency exposures, including derivatives positions, and use micro- and macroprudential tools to discourage the buildup of excessive leverage and foreign indebtedness. • safeguarding against market illiquidity and strength-ening market structures, which are priorities, espe-cially in advanced economies’ markets. • ensuring the soundness and health of banks and the long-term savings complex (for example, insurers and pension funds), which is critical, as highlighted

while avoiding downside risks. such an upside scenario would benefit the world economy and raise global output 0.4 percent above the baseline by 2018. further growth-enhancing structural reforms, detailed in the weo, could bring additional support to growth and stability, beyond the benefits detailed here.possible shocks or policy missteps could lead to a global asset market disruptionwithout the implementation of policies to ensure successful normalization, potential adverse shocks or policy missteps could trigger an abrupt rise in market risk premiums and a rapid erosion of policy confidence. shocks may originate in advanced or emerging markets and, combined with unaddressed system vulnerabilities, could lead to a global asset market disruption and a sud-den drying up of market liquidity in many asset classes. under these conditions, a significant—even if tempo-rary—mispricing of assets may ensue, with negative repercussions on financial stability (see chapter 2).in such an adverse scenario, substantially tighter financial conditions could stall the cyclical recovery and weaken confidence in medium-term growth prospects. low nominal growth would put pressure on debt-laden sovereign and private balance sheets, raising credit risks. emerging markets would face higher global risk premiums and substantial capital outflows, putting particular pressure on economies with domestic imbalances. corporate default rates would rise, particularly in china, raising financial system strains, with implications for growth. these events would lead to a reappearance of risks on sover-eign balance sheets, especially in europe’s vulnerable economies, and the emergence of an adverse feedback loop between corporate and sovereign risks in emerg-ing markets. as a result, aggregate global output could be as much as 2.4 percent lower by 2017, relative to the baseline. this implies lower but still positive global growth.']",structured

more difficult domestic and external environment, as policymakers have made judicious use of buffers in strengthened policy frameworks. commodity-related firms are cutting capital expenditures sharply as high private debt burdens reinforce risks to credit and banks. commodity-exporting countries and those in the middle east and the caucasus are particularly exposed to strains across the real economy and the financial sector. the nexus between state-owned enterprises (soes) and sovereigns has intensified, and could increase fiscal and financial stability risks in countries with repayment pressures. more broadly, debt belonging to nonfinancial corpora-tions with reduced ability to repay have risen to $650 billion, or 12 percent of total corporate debt of listed firms considered in this report. bank capital buffers are generally adequate, but will likely be tested by weaker earnings and the downturn in the credit cycle. emerging market economies generally have the tools to boost their resilience and counter the effects of lower commodity prices and the slowdown in growth and capital flows. authorities in emerg-ing market economies should continue to use their buffers and policy space, where available, to smooth adjustment and strengthen sovereign and bank bal-ance sheets. this includes using external buffers, fiscal and monetary policy, and macroprudential and supervisory frameworks, among other tools. coun-tries with insufficient buffers and limited policy space should act early by adjusting macroeconomic policies to address their vulnerabilities, including by seeking external support. china’s economic rebalancing is gaining traction. the country has made notable progress in rebalanc-ing its economy toward new sources of growth and addressing

rebalancing is inherently complex, and commitment to a more ambitious and comprehensive policy agenda is urgently needed to stay ahead of rising vulnerabilities. slowing growth has eroded corporate

of shocks, shaping macroprudential surveil-lance and policies to contain systemic risks arising from these channels will be vital.the resilience of market liquidity should be enhanced. as discussed in previous reports, a comprehensive approach to reducing risks of liquidity runs on mutual funds and strengthening the provision of market liquidity services is needed to avoid the risk of amplify-ing market shocks. the stakes are high. first, rising risks of weakening growth and more instability must be avoided. then, growth must be strengthened and financial stability improved beyond the

25,01/04/2014,73,2,"[' in ternational monetary fund | april 2014 ixthe global financial system is undergoing a number of challenging transitions on the path to greater stability. as the economic recovery in the united states gains foot-ing, u.s. monetary policy has begun to normalize. emerging market economies are transitioning to more sustainable growth in the financial sector, while addressing macroeconomic vulnerabilities amid a less favorable external financial environment. the euro area is strengthening bank capital positions as it moves from fragmentation to a more robust framework for integration. these transitions are far from complete, and stability conditions are far from normal. since october, bouts of financial turbulence have highlighted the substantial adjustment that lies ahead. in advanced economies, financial markets continue to be supported by extraor-dinary monetary accommodation and easy liquidity conditions. they will need to transition away from these supports if they are to create an environment of self-sustaining growth, marked by increased corporate investment and growing employment.for advanced and emerging market economies alike, a successful shift from “liquidity-driven” to “growth-driven” markets requires a number of elements, including a normalization of u.s. monetary policy that avoids financial stability risks; financial rebalancing in emerging market economies amid tighter external financial conditions; further progress in the euro area’s transition from fragmentation to robust integration; and the successful implementation of “abenomics” to deliver sustained growth and stable inflation in japan.the gradual shift to self-sustaining growth is most advanced in the united states, where green shoots are evident from the economic recovery under way, as noted in the april 2014 world economic outlook. the u.s. transition presents several challenges to financial stability. the “search for yield” is becoming increas-ingly extended, with rising leverage in the corporate sector and weakening underwriting standards in some pockets of u.s. credit markets. weaker market liquid-ity and the rapid growth of investment vehicles that are vulnerable to redemption risk could amplify finan-cial or economic shocks. in this transitional period, the reduction in u.s. monetary accommodation could have important spillovers to advanced and emerging market economies alike as portfolios adjust and risks are repriced.amid this shifting global environment, emerging market economies face their own transition challenges, but with substantial differences across economies. private and public balance sheets have become more leveraged since the beginning of the crisis and thus are more sensitive to changes in domestic and external conditions. macroeconomic imbalances have increased in a number of economies in the past few years, while the increased participation of foreign investors in domestic bond markets exposes some economies to an additional source of market volatility and pressure on capital flows. these developments have created a “systemic liquid-ity mismatch,” that is, a disjunction between the potential scale of capital outflows and the capacity of local institutions and market makers (in particular, international banks) to intermediate them. this bottle-neck could magnify the impact of any shocks emanat-ing from other economies and broaden the impact on asset prices, particularly if asset managers seek to hedge exposures by taking positions in more liquid but unrelated

this report suggests companies in many cases have sufficient buffers to withstand normal domestic or international shocks, although some vulnerabilities are evident. in a severe and adverse scenario where borrow-ing costs escalate and earnings deteriorate significantly, the debt at risk held by weaker, highly leveraged firms could increase by $740 billion, rising on average to 35 percent of total corporate debt in the sample of firms. in most emerging market economies, reported bank capital buffers and profitability generally remain high and should be sufficient to absorb moderate shocks to nonfinancial companies. nonetheless, in several economies, weak provisioning and lower levels of bank capital could present difficulties in the event of further balance sheet deterioration in the corporate sector. in china, the challenge for policymakers is to man-age an orderly transition toward more market disci-pline in the financial system, including the removal of implicit guarantees. in this process, investors and lenders will have to bear some costs of previous finan-cial excesses, and market prices will need to adjust to more accurately reflect risks. pace is important. if the adjustment is too fast, it risks creating turmoil; if too slow, it will allow vulnerabilities to continue build-ing. other keys to the success of an orderly transition include upgrading the central bank’s ability to address unpredictable shifts in liquidity demand, timely imple-mentation of deposit insurance and interest rate liber-alization, and strengthening the resolution framework for failed financial institutions.in the euro area, policies implemented at both the national and european levels are supporting the transition to a more robust framework for integration, but important challenges remain. the restructuring of the debt-burdened euro area corporate sector has been stalled by the unfinished repair of bank balance sheets. moreover, credit conditions remain difficult in stressed euro area economies. although market sentiment regarding stressed euro area banks and sovereigns has improved markedly, it may be running ahead of the necessary balance-sheet repair. thus, european policy-makers must push ahead with a rigorous and transpar-ent assessment of the current health of the banking system, followed by a determined cleansing of balance sheets and the removal of banks that are no longer viable. additional measures to improve nonbank credit and equity channels are also required. the resulting tangible strengthening of balance sheets will help rein-force the improved optimism in financial markets.in japan, continued monetary accommodation is necessary but not sufficient for renewed economic dynamism to take root. the transition to higher sustained growth and lower debt-related risks requires the enactment of persuasive structural reforms. the first stages of abenomics have been largely successful in altering deflationary expectations, but consolidating these gains in financial stability and expanding them will require continued efforts. more broadly, maintaining the momentum and impetus for reform and good policies may prove chal-lenging, amid a crowded electoral calendar in many countries. geopolitical risks related to ukraine could also pose a more serious threat to financial stability if they were to escalate. greater spillovers to activity beyond neighboring trading partners could emerge if further turmoil leads to a renewed bout of increased risk aversion in global financial markets, or from disruptions to trade and finance. against this back-drop, there is a need for strengthened and cooperative policy actions to help reduce risks of renewed turmoil in the global economy, both by reducing external imbalances and their associated internal distortions and by improving market confidence. furthermore, an enhanced dialog between supervisors in advanced and emerging market economies should help ensure that cross-border liquidity and credit are not disrupted. chapter 2 discusses the evolving landscape of portfolio investment in emerging market economies over the past 15 years. their financial markets have deepened and become more globalized. greater direct participation by global investors has stimulated the development of new asset class segments, including local currency sovereign debt markets. the mix of global investors has also changed, and bond funds have become more prominent—especially local currency funds, open-end funds with easy redemption options, and funds investing only opportunistically in emerg-ing market economies. chapter 2 draws on a variety of methods and relatively unexploited data to examine the implications of these changes for the stability of portfolio flows and asset prices in emerging market economies.it finds that changes in the composition of global portfolio investors are likely to make overall portfolio flows more sensitive to global financial shocks. the share of more volatile bond flows has risen, and larger in ternational monetary fund | april 2014 ixthe global financial system is undergoing a number of challenging transitions on the

the “search for yield” is becoming increas-ingly extended, with rising leverage in the corporate sector and weakening underwriting standards in some pockets of u.s. credit markets. weaker market liquid-ity and the rapid growth of investment vehicles that are vulnerable to redemption risk could amplify finan-cial or economic shocks. in this transitional period, the reduction in u.s. monetary accommodation could have important spillovers to advanced and emerging market economies alike as portfolios adjust and risks are repriced.amid this shifting global environment, emerging market economies face their own transition challenges, but with substantial differences across economies. private and public balance sheets have become more leveraged since the beginning of the crisis and thus are more sensitive to changes in domestic and external conditions. macroeconomic imbalances have increased in a number of economies in the past few years, while the increased participation of foreign investors in domestic bond markets exposes some economies to an additional source of market volatility and pressure on capital flows. these developments have created a “systemic liquid-ity mismatch,” that is, a disjunction between the potential scale of capital outflows and the capacity of local institutions and market makers (in particular, international banks) to intermediate them. this bottle-neck could magnify the impact of any shocks emanat-ing from other economies and broaden the impact on asset prices, particularly if asset managers seek to hedge exposures by taking positions in more liquid but unrelated markets. the mismatch could create circum-stances where authorities may have to provide liquidity transition from liquidity- to growth-driven marketsnormalizing

this report suggests companies in many cases have sufficient buffers to withstand normal domestic or international shocks, although some vulnerabilities are evident. in a severe and adverse scenario where borrow-ing costs escalate and earnings deteriorate significantly, the debt at risk held by weaker, highly leveraged firms could increase by $740 billion, rising on average to 35 percent of total corporate debt in the sample of firms. in most emerging market economies, reported bank capital buffers and profitability generally remain high and should be sufficient to absorb moderate shocks to nonfinancial companies. nonetheless, in several economies, weak provisioning and lower levels of bank capital could present difficulties in the event of further balance sheet deterioration in the corporate sector. in china, the challenge for policymakers is to man-age an orderly transition toward more market disci-pline in the financial system, including the removal of implicit guarantees. in this process, investors and lenders will have to bear some costs of previous finan-cial excesses, and market prices will need to adjust to more accurately reflect risks. pace is important. if the adjustment is too fast, it risks creating turmoil; if too slow, it will allow vulnerabilities to continue build-ing. other keys to the success of an orderly transition include upgrading the central bank’s ability to address unpredictable shifts in liquidity demand, timely imple-mentation of deposit insurance and interest rate liber-alization, and strengthening the resolution framework for failed financial institutions.in the euro area, policies implemented at both the national and european levels are supporting the transition to a more robust framework for integration, but important challenges remain. the restructuring of the debt-burdened euro area corporate sector has been stalled by the unfinished repair of bank balance sheets. moreover, credit conditions remain difficult in stressed euro area economies. although market sentiment regarding stressed euro area banks and sovereigns has improved markedly, it may be running ahead of the necessary balance-sheet repair. thus, european policy-makers must push ahead with a rigorous and transpar-ent assessment of the current health of the banking system, followed by a determined cleansing of balance sheets and the removal of banks that are no longer viable. additional measures to improve nonbank credit and equity channels are also required. the resulting tangible strengthening of balance sheets will help rein-force the improved optimism in financial markets.in japan, continued monetary accommodation is necessary but not sufficient for renewed economic dynamism to take root. the transition to higher sustained growth and lower debt-related risks requires the enactment of persuasive structural reforms. the first stages of abenomics have been largely successful in altering deflationary expectations, but consolidating these gains in financial stability and expanding them will require continued efforts. more broadly, maintaining the momentum and impetus for reform and good policies may prove chal-lenging, amid a crowded electoral calendar in many countries. geopolitical risks related to ukraine could also pose a more serious threat to financial stability if they were to escalate. greater spillovers to activity beyond neighboring trading partners could emerge if further turmoil leads to a renewed bout of increased risk aversion in global financial markets, or from disruptions to trade and finance. against this back-drop, there is a need for strengthened and cooperative policy actions to help reduce risks of renewed turmoil in the global economy, both by reducing external imbalances and their associated internal distortions and by improving market confidence. furthermore, an enhanced dialog between supervisors in advanced and emerging market economies should help ensure that cross-border liquidity and credit are not disrupted. chapter 2 discusses the evolving landscape of portfolio investment in emerging market economies over the past 15 years. their financial markets have deepened and become more globalized. greater direct participation by global investors has stimulated the development of new asset class segments, including local currency sovereign debt markets. the mix of global investors has also changed, and bond funds have become more prominent—especially local currency funds, open-end funds with easy redemption options, and funds investing only opportunistically in emerg-ing market economies. chapter 2 draws on a variety of methods and relatively unexploited data to examine the implications of these changes for the stability of portfolio flows and asset prices in emerging market economies.it finds that changes in the composition of global portfolio investors are likely to make overall portfolio flows more sensitive to global financial shocks. the share of more volatile bond flows has risen, and larger international monetary fund | april 2014 xiforeign participation in local markets can transmit new instability. the growing activity of institutional investors is potentially more stable, but when fac-ing an extreme shock, they can pull back even more strongly and persistently than other asset managers. while domestic macroeconomic conditions matter, herd behavior among global funds continues, and there are few signs that differentiation along local macroeco-nomic fundamentals during crises has increased over the past 15 years. however, the progress made so far by emerging market economies in promoting a larger local investor base, deepening their banking sectors and capital mar-kets, and improving their institutions has reduced their sensitivity to global financial shocks. a continuation of these efforts can help emerging market economies reap benefits from financial globalization while minimizing its potential costs. chapter 3 looks at how implicit funding subsidies for banks considered too important to fail (titf) have changed over the past few years. government protection for titf banks creates a variety of prob-lems: an uneven playing field, excessive risk taking, and large costs for the public sector. because credi-tors of titf institutions do not bear the full cost of failure, they are willing to provide funding without paying much attention to the banks’ risk profiles, thereby encouraging leverage and risk taking. dur-ing the global financial crisis, governments intervened with large amounts of funds to support distressed banks and safeguard financial stability, leaving little uncertainty about their willingness to bail out failing titf institutions. these developments have further reinforced incentives for banks to become large, and indeed, the concentration of the banking sector in many economies has increased. in response, policy-makers have undertaken ambitious financial reforms to make the financial system safer, including address-ing the titf problem. chapter 3 assesses whether these policy efforts are sufficient to alleviate the titf issue. in particular, it investigates the evolution of the funding cost advan-tages enjoyed by systemically important banks (sibs). the expectation of government support in case of distress represents an implicit public subsidy to those banks. this subsidy rose in all economies during the crisis. although it has declined in most economies since then, it remains elevated, especially in the euro area, likely reflecting different speeds of balance-sheet repair as well as differences in the policy response to the problems in the banking sector. nonetheless, the expected probability that sibs will be bailed out in case of distress has remained high in all regions. although not all measures have been implemented yet, there is still scope for a further strengthening of reforms. these reforms include enhancing capital requirements for sibs or imposing a financial stabil-ity contribution based on the size of the liabilities of banks. progress is also needed in facilitating the supervision and resolution of cross-border financial institutions. in these areas, international coordination is critical to avoid new distortions and negative cross-country spillovers, which may have become even more important because of country-specific policy reforms.']",structured

that could raise domestic xii international monetary fund | october 2012financial stability risks. local bond markets have continued to attract inflows even as the euro area crisis intensified. overall, many countries in central and eastern europe are the most vulnerable because of their direct exposures to the euro area and certain similarities they bear to countries in the euro area periphery. asia and latin america generally appear more resilient, but several key regional economies are prone to the risks associated with being in the late phase of a credit cycle that has featured an extended period of rising property prices and debt. mean-while, the scope to provide fresh policy stimulus is somewhat constrained in several economies, which underscores the need to deftly manage country-specific challenges. the crisis has spurred a host of regulatory reforms to make the financial system safer. chap-ter 3 contains an interim report on whether these reforms are moving the financial sector in the right direction against a benchmark set of desirable features—financial institutions and markets that are more transparent, less complex, and less leveraged. the analysis suggests that, although there has been some progress over the past five years, financial sys-tems have not come much closer to those desirable features. they are still overly complex, with strong domestic interbank linkages, and concentrated, with the too-important-to-fail issues unresolved. while there has not yet been any serious setback to financial globalization, in the absence of appropriate policies economies are still susceptible to harmful cross-border spillovers. progress has been limited partly because many regulatory reforms are still in the early stages of implementation and partly because crisis intervention measures are still in use by a number of economies, delaying the “reboot-ing” of the financial system onto a safer path. although the reforms currently under way are likely to produce a safer banking system over time, the chapter points to some areas that still require atten-tion: (1)\xa0a global discussion of the pros and cons of direct restrictions on business activities to address the too-important-to-fail issue, (2) more attention to segments of the nonbank system that may be posing systemic risks, and (3) further progress on recovery and resolution plans for large institutions, especially those that operate across borders. chapter 4 tackles the fundamental question of whether certain aspects of financial structure enhance economic outcomes. are the forces cur-rently changing financial structures, including regulatory reforms, likely to result in structures that will support higher, less volatile growth and a more stable financial system? the chapter finds that some structural features are indeed associated with better outcomes and others with less growth and more volatility. in particular, financial buffers (both for capital and liquidity) tend to be associated with better economic performance, whereas some types of nontraditional bank intermediation are linked to less favorable results. the analysis also indicates that certain positive characteristics may sometimes turn negative. for instance, some measures of cross-border connections are beneficial most of the time, but if not managed properly they can act as conduits to transmit destabilizing shocks during a crisis. overall, the analysis needs to be interpreted carefully, since it is constrained by important gaps in data and a relatively short sample period that included the global financial crisis. as a result, the policy conclusions can only be viewed as tenta-tive. nonetheless, two of those that emerge are that (1)\xa0financial buffers made up of high-quality capital and truly liquid assets generally help economic per-formance; and (2) banks’ global interconnectivity needs to be managed well so as to reap the benefits of cross-border activities, while limiting adverse spillovers during a crisis. both chapters 3 and 4 also stress that the success of steps aimed at producing a safer financial system hinges on effective implementation and strong supervision. without those elements, regulatory reform may fail to secure greater financial stability.']",structured

the backdrop of continued global growth, none of the individually identiﬁed risks by themselves threaten ﬁnancial stability. how-ever, with volatility across asset classes close to historic lows and spreads on a variety of credit instruments tight, investors may not have ade-quately factored in the possibility that a “volatil-ity shock” may be ampliﬁed given the increased linkages across products and markets. institu-tions may well be acting in accordance with their own incentives, but collectively their behavior may cause a buildup of investment positions in certain markets, possibly resulting in a disor-derly correction when conditions change. for instance, the rapid growth of some innovative instruments, the rise in leverage in parts of the ﬁnancial system, and the growth of carry trades suggest that market participants are expecting a continuation of the low volatility environment and that a sustained rise in volatility could per-turb a wide range of markets.chapter ii examines the recent acceleration in the accumulation of international assets as well as the investors behind rising cross-border ﬂows. as noted above, ﬂows and stocks of cross-border claims have increased both in absolute size and relative to the volume of domestic economic activity. the diversity of assets, source countries, and investor types now involved in cross-border asset accumulation suggests more stable ﬂows. however, for some countries, the sharp increase in capital inﬂows has contributed to rapid credit growth and asset price inﬂa-tion, at times complicating the conduct of poli-cies. furthermore, foreign investors have been venturing into markets previously regarded as excessively risky for outsiders, encouraged by the generally benign ﬁnancial environment. policymakers can take advantage of these secular changes and at the same time minimize pockets of vulnerabilities that have become apparent. recipient countries have to con-tinue to establish a track record of credible macroeconomic policies. vulnerabilities can be reduced by promoting efﬁciency, stability, and the effective regulation of domestic capital mar-kets (including the development of local debt markets) so as to increase their attractiveness to a stable investor base. liberalization of capital outﬂows from domestic investors, though not a panacea, may help balance the effects of capital inﬂows and allow domestic investors to better manage their risk.chapter iii examines the implications of the accelerating globalization of ﬁnancial institutions––particularly banks––for global ﬁnancial stability. the institutional and regional pattern of globalization is remarkably varied. for large banks, greater geographical disper-sion of assets and revenues tends to be associ-ated with better share price performance and lower default risks. however, while cross-border diversiﬁcation seems to be associated positively with the stability of the individual institution, the ﬁnancial system as a whole may not be more stable, with the potential for linkages among markets and activities having increased. this is an especially important result for countries in regions with heavy foreign bank penetration across correlated economies.the chapter highlights two clear priorities to help to contain the potential contagion risk arising from institutional globalization while maximizing its beneﬁts. first, supervisors need to collaborate ever more closely in the oversight of cross-border institutions. second, authorities need to continue improving crisis management procedures with the counterparts with whom they share the greatest overlapping responsi-bilities and interests. while the jurisdiction of supervisors and regulators remains predomi-nantly domestic, at odds with the scope of activi-ties of global institutions, these practical steps can go some way toward addressing the chal-lenges to ﬁnancial stability posed by institutional

accommodative macroeconomic policies (see the april 2011 world economic outlook), but fragilities remain. the two-speed recovery—modest in advanced econo-mies and robust in emerging market economies—has posed different policy challenges for countries. in advanced economies hit hardest by the crisis, govern-ments and households remain heavily indebted, to varying degrees, and the health of financial institutions has not recovered in tandem with the overall economy. emerging market economies are facing new challenges associated with strong domestic demand, rapid credit growth, relatively accommodative macroeconomic pol-icies, and large capital inflows. geopolitical risks could also threaten the economic and financial outlook, with oil prices increasing sharply amid fears of supply disruptions in the middle east and north africa.the main task facing policymakers in advanced econ-omies is to shift the balance of policies away from reli-ance on macroeconomic and liquidity support to more structural policies—less “leaning” and more “cleaning” of the financial system. this will entail reducing leverage and restoring market discipline, while avoiding financial or economic disruption during the transition. thus, ongoing policy efforts to withdraw (implicit) public guarantees and ensure bondholder liability for future losses must build on more rapid progress toward stron-ger bank balance sheets, ensuring medium-term fiscal sustainability and addressing excessive debt burdens in the private sector. for policymakers in emerging market economies, the task is to limit overheating and a buildup of vul-nerabilities—to avoid “cleaning” later. emerging mar-ket economies have continued to benefit from strong growth relative to that in advanced economies, accom-panied by increasing portfolio capital inflows. this is putting pressure on some financial markets, contribut-ing to higher leverage, potential asset price bubbles, and inflationary pressures. policymakers will have to pay increasing attention to containing the buildup of macrofinancial risks to avoid future problems that could inhibit their growth and damage financial stability. in a number of cases, this will entail a tighter macroeconomic policy stance, and, when needed, the use of macroprudential tools to ensure financial stabil-ity. increasing the financial sector’s capacity to absorb higher flows through efforts to broaden and deepen local capital markets will also help. in the next few months, the most pressing challenge is the funding of banks and sovereigns, particularly in some vulnerable euro area countries. as detailed in chapter 1 of this global financial stability report, policies aimed at fiscal consolidation and strengthening bank balance sheets in these countries should be sup-ported by credible assurances that multilateral backstops are sufficiently flexible and endowed to facilitate an orderly deleveraging without triggering further fiscal or bank funding strains. in other countries, funding is less problematic, but still a concern. under a baseline scenario, higher funding costs and a rising government debt stock will cause government interest payments to increase in most advanced economies (see also the april 2011 fiscal monitor). if deficit reduction con-tinues as projected, the interest costs should generally remain manageable, although much greater progress on medium-term fiscal consolidation strategies will be needed in both the united states and japan to avoid downside risks to financial stability and to preserve

levels, if a detrimental xii international monetary fund | april 2011process of deleveraging is to be avoided, and a set of mostly smaller banks will have to be restructured and, where necessary, resolved. in the united states, a lackluster housing market, legacy mortgage problems, and a backlog of foreclosures continue to put pres-sure on the banking system, limiting credit creation and a return to a fully functioning mortgage market. larger bank capital buffers and strengthened balance sheets will also be necessary as countries transition to a new and more demanding regulatory regime. countries in which banking systems are still strug-gling should enhance transparency (including through more rigorous and realistic stress tests) and recapitalize, restructure, and (if necessary) close weak institutions. without these longer-term financial sector reforms, short-term funding difficulties may escalate into another systemic liquidity event. measuring and mitigating systemic liquidity risks should be at the forefront of the agenda of policymak-ers. those risks were a main feature of the latest crisis and have yet to be addressed. chapter 2 takes a close look at this topic, examining the role that basel iii liquidity requirements will play when they are intro-duced. the analysis suggests that, while helping to raise liquidity buffers, basel iii will be unable to fully address the systemic nature of liquidity risk. the chap-ter provides some illustrative techniques for measuring systemic liquidity risk and firms’ contribution to it, and suggests some accompanying macroprudential tools that could, after further refinement and testing, be used to mitigate such risks. for instance, one of the approaches provides a way to gauge, based on a firm’s assets and liabilities and its interbank connections, the higher capital needed to ensure that its risk of insolvency does not cause a destabilizing liquidity run during stressful periods. tools of this type would allow for more effective sharing of the private-public burden of systemic liquidity risk and help reduce central bank interventions during periods of stress.a common feature of the crisis in many coun-tries was excessive and misallocated credit growth, which helped fuel housing market booms. chapter 3 examines the connections between the housing finance systems and financial stability, noting that the structure of some countries’ housing finance systems led to a deeper housing bust and financial instability. the chapter suggests a set of best practices for hous-ing finance. for the united states, where the housing market and its financing are still problematic, these best practices imply that there should be better-defined and more transparent government participa-tion in the housing market, including a diminished role of the two large government-sponsored entities (freddie mac and fannie mae). these goals will need to be pursued incrementally, while taking into account the still-weak housing market and economic recovery. economies seeking to create a strong housing finance system are advised to “go back to basics”—ensuring safe loan origination and encourag-ing simple and transparent mortgage contracts.global financial stabilit y report durable financial stability: getting there from here']",structured

41,13/09/2023,93,41,"In an era of heightened awareness surrounding environmental sustainability and corporate responsibility, businesses are under increasing pressure to accurately report their carbon emissions and sustainability efforts. The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) is a vital platform for organisations to transparently share their environmental data, strategies, and commitments. However, successful CDP reporting requires a year-round strategic approach that goes beyond simply meeting July disclosure deadlines.This article delves into five crucial practices that sustainable businesses should adopt now to ensure effective CDP reporting while fostering long-term environmental stewardship.1. Don’t lose momentumMany organisations only start their CDP reporting shortly prior to the deadline and treat the disclosure as a project, but CDP reporting is an integral component of a company’s sustainability strategy. Embedding CDP reporting as part of an ongoing program will ensure that you are checking in on post-CDP actions and laying the foundations for next year’s reporting.This approach not only bolsters the credibility of your reporting but also cultivates an internal “culture of sustainability” within the organisation. By consistently addressing environmental concerns throughout the year, companies can seamlessly integrate sustainability practices into their operations and prepare for subsequent reporting cycles with enhanced readiness and accuracy.2. Assurance needsAs the importance of verified greenhouse gas (GHG) data continues to rise, third-party assurance of reported data becomes a key priority. Planning for assurance well in advance is critical. Aligning with third-party auditors' schedules and incorporating verification into the annual reporting cycle ensures a smoother process and minimises the risk of last-minute inconsistencies.This proactive approach boosts transparency, instils investor confidence, and reinforces your commitment to accurate reporting, meeting both regulatory requirements and stakeholder expectations.3. Allocating approvalsEstablishing a clear approval and sign-off process at the outset of your sustainability program is crucial. Defining stakeholders responsible for providing approvals ensures they understand the time required to align with the CDP reporting deadline. Transparent communication regarding timelines and necessary inputs minimises delays and misunderstandings.By facilitating a well-structured approval process, organisations can streamline reporting procedures, allowing for more efficient data aggregation, and ensuring that the final submission accurately represents their sustainability endeavours.4. Coverage reviewUnderstanding your data coverage, particularly concerning Scope 3 emissions, is paramount for comprehensive CDP reporting. Conducting an in-depth analysis post-CDP submission can reveal potential gaps in material categories where data might be lacking. Identifying these gaps ahead of time enables engagement with relevant departments to gather essential information.This approach ensures a complete representation of sustainability efforts, highlighting accomplishments in emissions reduction and resource conservation across all relevant areas.5. Recognise the time to agree commitmentsMaking significant commitments, such as science-based targets and carbon transition plans, demands thorough planning and alignment. These commitments often need months of defining, stakeholder engagement, and internal approval processes. Identifying the support required, both internally and externally in advance, assists the clear definition and approval of commitments well before the CDP reporting deadline. This proactive strategy ensures that commitments reflect your organisation's sustainability strategy.By incorporating these five practices into their sustainability strategies, businesses can go beyond meeting the CDP reporting requirements. Proactive planning, ongoing momentum, data assurance, streamlined approval processes, and comprehensive data coverage all contribute to a holistic and accurate representation of an organization's commitment to sustainability.Greenstone and CDPGreenstone has been part of CDP’s Accredited Software Program since 2013.

42,06/09/2023,56,30,"SBTi recently published its fourth report titled ""SBTi Monitoring Report 2022 - Looking back at 2022 and moving forward to 2023 and beyond"". This comprehensive report delves into the worldwide advancements of science-based targets and reveals a remarkable ongoing surge in the adoption of science-targets by companies and financial institutions. This trend persists despite the escalating challenges prevalent on the global stage.Greenstone has curated an article that captures the key insights from this report.Established in 2014, The Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) is a collaboration among organisations including CDP, United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute (WRI), World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), and the We Mean Business Coalition. It assists global companies and financial institutions in setting science-based GHG emissions reduction targets, striving for ambitious corporate climate action. The SBTi mission involves aligning businesses with climate science, cutting emissions, and contributing to the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C.SBTi prioritises emission reduction, offering sector-specific guidance for high-emission industries and facilitating action in areas like maritime and aviation. Their approach aims to make ambitious climate action mainstream across sectors, urging the necessary transformations for a net-zero world. This includes collaboration with large companies and their supply chains. SBTi believes this multi-pronged approach will effectively accelerate private sector emissions reduction in harmony with the Paris Agreement.""SBTi Monitoring Report 2022 - Looking back at 2022 and moving forward to 2023 and beyond"" presents the major developments in the adoption of science-based targets by companies and financial institutions in the year 2022, along with updates and publications from the SBTi over the same period.The data analysed in this report is up to date as of December 31, 2022. To ensure inclusiveness, information published after this date, as recent as June 2023, has been incorporated. These additional sources include company sustainability reports, corporate publications, and relevant non-financial reports accessible at the time of review.""1. The adoption of science-based targets surged in 2022, surpassing the combined figures of the previous seven years. A total of 1,097 companies had validated targets published, compared to 1,082 in the preceding seven years. With 587 targets established in 2021, there was an 87% year-on-year increase in validated targets. Commitments to set science-based targets also rose, with 1,287 companies committing to this within 24 months as per the SBTis Commitment Compliance Policy. By the close of 2022, 2,079 companies had validated science-based targets, and an additional 2,151 companies committed to setting targets.  "",2. Nearly all SBTi companies with targets are addressing scope 3 emissions. In 2022, 406 companies that set targets also included scope 3 targets. This raised the overall count of companies with science-based targets covering scope 3 (excluding SMEs and financial institutions) to 1,134, accounting for 96% by the end of 2022. Among companies that introduced scope 3 targets in 2022, 63 established supplier engagement targets, encouraging suppliers in their value chains to set their own science-based targets. Consequently, the total number of companies with supplier and customer engagement targets reached 189, equivalent to 16% of all companies with science-based targets by the conclusion of 2022.""3. Companies had their targets validated against the SBTis Corporate Net-Zero Standard for the first full year in 2022. The Net-Zero Standard, introduced in October 2021, represents SBTis most ambitious decarbonisation level, necessitating both near and long-term science-based targets to achieve complete emissions reduction by 2050. Of the 130 organisations that established net-zero targets in 2022, 78 (60%) were categorised as companies, with the remaining 40% being SMEs. Additionally, 889 companies committed to presenting net-zero targets. These net-zero objectives constituted 12% of all science-based targets set in 2022.  "",4. In 2022, the largest count of companies establishing targets was in Japan (201), trailed by the UK (181) and the US (109). Asia exhibited the most substantial relative expansion in companies setting targets, while Africa and Latin America also observed notable growth.5. The cumulative scope 1 and 2 emissions from companies adopting science-based targets reached 422 million tonnes of CO2e by the end of 2022. This marked a significant upsurge of 27% compared to 2021 and exceeded the total greenhouse gas emissions of the UK for the same year. The combined scope 1 and 2 emissions addressed through science-based targets escalated nearly 15-fold from 145 million to two billion tonnes of CO2e between 2015 and 2022.1.5°C - As of July 2022, the SBTi has only accepted new target submissions which are aligned with 1.5°C.34% - By the end of 2022, companies with science-based targets or which had committed to set targets represented over a third (34%) of the global economy by market capitalisation.88% - By the end of 2022, 88% of companies listed on France’s CAC Index had set or committed to set targets, compared to 70% on Germany’s DAX Index, 69% of companies on the UK’s FTSE, 43% on Italy’s MIB, 42% of all S&amp;P companies and 40% of companies listed on Japan’s NIKKEI Index.58% - There was significant growth in the number of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) setting targets, with SMEs representing the majority (58%) of organisations setting targets in 2022.60% - The materials industry saw the highest growth in the number of companies setting targets. 60% of companies setting targets came from the service, manufacturing and infrastructure industries. The three lowest represented industries – power generation, biotech, healthcare and pharma, and hospitality – saw little change.79% - By the end of 2022, 79% of all companies with science-based targets were 1.5°C-aligned for scopes 1 and 2.76m - As of December 2022, total committed annual emissions reductions across all approved science-based targets were 76 million tonnes of CO2e, equivalent to eliminating Switzerland’s 2022 annual CO2 emissions more than twice over.76% - More than three quarters (76%) of companies with science-based targets publicly reported progress against their targets in some form. More than half (53%) of companies fully reported progress on all their near-term and long-term targets in 2022, while around a quarter (23%) reported on at least one target. Half the financial institutions with science-based targets reported publicly on progress of their targets via CDP.Greenstone produces relevant content to help companies learn more about science-based and net-zero targets.

43,23/08/2023,28,27,"Across the asset-management world, interest in Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance has soared over the past few years. ESG factors into investment decisions and portfolio management strategies are increasingly becoming the norm and investors are seeking to better understand a company’s long-term value by looking at ESG information.However, this trend in responsible investment and ESG reporting is presenting investors with many challenges when it comes to gathering, maintaining, and analysing ESG data. Gaining access to accurate, credible, and consistent ESG data and supporting information is difficult.\xa0Investors are now looking for purpose-built ESG software platforms to collect, track and analyse data and material ESG KPIs from their portfolios on an ongoing basis. ESG software is the obvious way to streamline the ESG data collection, questionnaire distribution and management process.In this article, we will explore some of the reasons why investors are seeking ESG software to manage portfolio data.ESG investing stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance investing. It is an investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social, and governance considerations into the selection and management of investments. The goal of ESG investing is to generate long-term financial returns while also addressing societal and environmental concerns.Benefits of ESG investing include:""Improved risk management: ESG factors can serve as early warning signs for potential problems that could negatively impact a companys financial performance.Better alignment with personal values: ESG investing allows investors to align their investments with their personal values.Improved long-term financial performance: Companies with strong ESG practices tend to have better long-term financial performance.ESG investing addresses People, Planet and Profit, as it looks at how companies operate in terms of environmental impact, treatment of workers and community, and governance.53% of companies with more than US$10b revenue\xa0per year\xa0say that they “face short-term earnings pressure from investors, which impedes our longer-term investments in sustainability.”46% of North American investors\xa0agree that the lack of robust ESG data is one of the main ESG adoption hurdles. 91% of business leaders\xa0believe their company has a responsibility to act on ESG issues.""ESG software is a technology that helps investors assess and analyse the ESG performance of existing and potential investments. It provides a centralised platform to collect and manage ESG data and provides investors with a comprehensive view of a companys sustainability practices, including their impact on ESG practices. This information can be used to make informed investment decisions that align with an investors values and goals, as well as to identify companies that are leading the way in sustainability. ESG software typically includes features such as data analysis dashboards, carbon emissions calculation, customisable reporting options, and user-friendly tools to help investors make investment decisions based on accurate data.Sustainable investing has become increasingly important for investors who want to align their values and investments with the long-term health of our planet and society. As the demand for ESG-focused investment strategies continues to grow, ESG software has emerged as a crucial tool for investors who want to manage their portfolio data effectively. ESG software provides investors with real-time access to ESG data and analysis, allowing them to assess the ESG performance of their investments, set goals, and monitor their progress towards a more sustainable future.The monitoring of performance over time is essential to understand long-term risks and opportunities. To build a sustainable long-term investment strategy that will support investment decisions, investors need access to current and correct data for both now and in the future – not just a time-stamped data set.Access to accurate and consistent ESG data to enable responsible investment decisions is now more important than ever. There is a plethora of ESG frameworks and guidelines available for ESG reporting but, for investors, working out which ESG metrics to request from companies is challenging. Before seeking data, investors need to be sure that that data will reliably support their investment decisions and accurately enable their long-term sustainability strategy.Managing funds and portfolio companies can be a complex and time-consuming task for investors, especially when it comes to incorporating ESG into their investment process. ESG software can simplify this process by providing investors with a centralised platform for managing their portfolio data. This includes ESG data and analysis, allowing investors to track the ESG performance of their investments and monitor changes over time.Many firms are still using spreadsheets and emails and, as data gets more complex, these processes become cumbersome, time-consuming and prone to error. Manual processes are not only a security risk but are also prone to risk and error and are extremely heavy on time and resources.Meeting the latest reporting standards is crucial for investors who are committed to sustainable investing and ESG, as it helps to ensure the accuracy and reliability of ESG data. By meeting these standards, investors can be confident that the ESG data they receive is relevant, credible, and up-to-date. This helps to avoid potential risks associated with using inaccurate or outdated ESG data, such as making misguided investment decisions. In addition, meeting the latest reporting standards is important for investors who are looking to demonstrate their ESG commitment to their stakeholders.Investors are seeking to understand the ESG-related business risks and opportunities companies face. This includes assessing the potential impact of ESG factors on a company’s long-term business model and the resilience of companies to adapt to ESG changes. Over time, these considerations may reshape competitive advantages and ultimately the sustainability of business growth and long-term value creation for shareholders.Portfolio company engagement in ESG performance can be a challenge for investors and sometimes there can be little to no communication lines between the two parties. There are huge benefits to communication and engagement between asset managers and their portfolio companies.""ESG software makes market and competitor outperformance easy by providing access to ESG data and analysis, allowing investors to track their investments ESG performance over time and compare it to the performance of their peers and competitors. This helps investors to identify areas for improvement and make informed decisions about their investments that can lead to better ESG outcomes.Having access to ESG data and analysis allows investors to assess the ESG performance of their investments and compare it to their peers and competitors. With this information, investors can identify areas where they can improve their ESG performance, set specific ESG goals, and track their progress over time.With a surge in the setting of Science-Based Targets (SBTs)and net-zero pathways, investors are using ESG software to accurately measure, monitor and report carbon performance. Calculating, reporting, and reducing Scope 3 emissions in accordance with the GHG Protocol is challenging for investors because the required data comes from outside of its own operations.Obtaining accurate GHG emissions across an investment portfolio has long been a pain point for investors and GPs have often employed consultants to calculate the GHG emissions from their portfolio which can be limited, lengthy and expensive. The right ESG software solution leverages primary data, industry-approved estimations, data validation tools and approvals to ensure verification-ready data throughout the year.ESG reporting for private capital investors is complicated by both the lack of regulation and the lack of clean and effective gathering, maintenance and analysis of ESG data. In public markets, there are multiple providers of ESG data but very little correlation, and the tendency to scrape data has its own problems.",unstructured
44,16/08/2023,73,40,"Procurement and supply chain management is evolving, and so are the ways businesses interact with their suppliers, manage their relationships with them, and make purchasing decisions.Procurement teams are not only tasked with ensuring that suppliers meet the standards set by their organisation and that the business is not exposed to supply chain risk. They are also responsible for building and maintaining supplier relationships and looking for ways to engage with their supplier base. On top of this, now more than ever, procurement professionals are under scrutiny to also ensure that their business and supply chain is operating sustainably; from an environmental, social, governance (ESG) and compliance perspective. Supply chain sustainability software is the obvious way to streamline the supplier data collection, questionnaire distribution and management process. Procurement professionals are now seeking purpose-built supply chain sustainability software platforms to collect, track and analyse supplier data and GHG emissions on an ongoing basis. This blog focuses on a number of key reasons why procurement professionals are seeking supply chain sustainability software.1. Transparency and comparabilitySupply chain sustainability software\xa0enables buyers to customise questionnaires and data collection to ensure they are collecting the right data. Once collected, the software will enable them to aggregate consistent, comparable and accurate performance data from across their supplier network. It also enables users to compare, benchmark and score portfolio companies and view key information across various metrics and KPIs.2. Facilitates engagementSupplier engagement in performance and compliance can be a challenge for organisations and sometimes there can be little to no communication lines between the two parties. There are huge benefits to communication and engagement between buyers and their suppliers, and building relationships requires engagement.A credible software solution will enable communication between both parties and facilitate direct online conversations around very specific issues. Beyond due diligence and receiving alerts for flagged issues, a software solution enables buyers to engage with suppliers and help them to improve in areas of underperformance. This enables the building of more sustainable and collaborative relationships.3. Reduces riskDespite growing stakeholder pressure, many companies still do not have an understanding of compliance, potential risks and impacts of their supply chain.\xa0Without a clear understanding of the status of your suppliers at any given time, the potential for risks to go undetected increases exponentially.Greenstone’s supply chain sustainability software\xa0has a risk management tool to automatically create actions for suppliers that have triggered defined types or risks. These actions are sent to suppliers with automated notifications, deadlines, and direct messaging services streamlining the process. The key being that even a small team can manage the supplier action plans by clearly understanding what activity needs to happen in the system at any given time.4. Saves time and resourcesMany companies are still using spreadsheets and emails and, as data gets more complex, these processes become cumbersome, time-consuming and prone to error. Manual processes are not only a security risk but are also prone to risk and error and are extremely heavy on time and resources.Through the use of software, data collection, management and reporting can all be automated, on a large scale, which leaves teams more time for analysis. Using software enables organisations to move their focus away from just data collection and on to in-depth reporting, analysis and informed decision-making.5. Enables the monitoring of performance over timeUsing a central software platform to collect and manage the supplier data enables procurement and sustainability teams to assess performance data on an ongoing basis, rather than in one moment in time. By sending questionnaires directly to suppliers through a software solution, deadlines, flags and notifications can be set which means that buyers can be automatically alerted when it’s time to request updated information or address an expired document. Scoring of suppliers also ensures that year-on-year improvements can be realised and minimum performance thresholds can be met.6. Enables the collection of scope 3 GHG emissions dataScope 3 emissions, also known as value chain emissions, are indirect GHG emissions both upstream and downstream of an organisation’s main operations. This usually means all of the emissions a company is responsible for outside of its own operations—the majority often being from suppliers.Utilising software for calculating and managing scope 3 emissions in the supply chain will enable reporting organisations to engage more effectively with larger numbers of suppliers and simplify the process of emissions reporting. Both buyers and suppliers are likely to be tackling this for the first time, and so will need a solution that is both scalable and that can evolve with their needs.Greenstone’s SupplierPortal supply chain sustainability software solution provides your business with a single point of transparency across your supplier network, ensuring that compliance, performance, and risk can be managed seamlessly.

45,09/08/2023,9,5,"The European Commission has adopted the first set of 12 European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), and large and listed EU companies will be required to use these standards from January 2024, as part of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). The European Commission together with the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) have been working to ensure that the ESRS take into account discussions with the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) to improve alignment between EU and global sustainability reporting standards and prevent unnecessary double reporting by companies, particularly in the area of climate-related disclosures.The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) is one of the latest EU Regulations regarding Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and non-financial reporting, aiming to speed up EU progress on reaching Net-Zero. It is a step up from the current EU Regulation the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD), expanding the number of mandatory reporting companies from 11,600 to 49,000. The CSRD requires mandatory reporting and therefore holds companies accountable for their ESG actions and policies, encouraging a push for sustainability. The legislation works in harmony with the GRI Standards and expands on the current EU Sustainable Finance Taxonomy.All information necessary to understand how climate change will affect the business, as well as the impact the business has on people and the planet must be reported. The CSRD will focus on the concept of double materiality between economic and ESG performance and introduces the EU Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS).The ESRS outline the mandatory concepts and principles with which companies reporting under the CSRD must align their sustainability statements. The goal is to provide investors, civil society organisations, consumers, and other stakeholders with more comprehensive and comparable sustainability information to evaluate companies\' sustainability performance as part of the European green deal. The ESRS are based on technical advice from the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) and have been developed with input from various stakeholders. The standards cover a wide range of environmental, social, and governance issues, including climate change, biodiversity, and human rights, and take a ""double materiality"" perspective, requiring companies to report on their impacts on people and the environment, as well as how social and environmental issues create financial risks and opportunities for the company.",unstructured
46,02/08/2023,71,35,"The growing interest in ESG, corporate responsibility and sustainability has resulted in the appearance of many different terms trying to describe interconnected and parallel concepts. Understanding these terms is essential for organisations that want to make informed decisions about their impact on the environment and society. ESG, sustainability, and CSR are three terms that are often used interchangeably but are, in fact, distinct from one another. In this article, we will explain each term, highlight key differences, and discuss their relationship and impact.ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance. It most commonly refers to a quantifiable assessment of an organisation’s activities in each of these areas. ESG performance metrics are often used by investors and rating agencies to evaluate the strategies of businesses in managing the risks and opportunities associated with ESG factors.Environmental factors include a company’s use of renewable energy sources, its waste management program, how it handles potential problems of air or water pollution arising from its operations, deforestation issues (if applicable), and its attitude and actions around climate change issues. Other possible environmental issues include raw material sourcing (e.g., whether the company uses fair trade suppliers and organic ingredients) and whether a company follows biodiversity practices on land it owns or controls.Social factors cover a vast range of potential issues including diversity, employee benefits and human rights. There are many separate social aspects of ESG, but all of them are essentially about social relationships. One of the key relationships for a company, from the point of view of many socially responsible investors, is its relationship with its employees.Governance, in the context of ESG, is essentially about how a company is managed by those in the top-floor executive offices. How well do executive management and the board of directors attend to the interests of the company’s various stakeholders – employees, suppliers, shareholders, and customers? Does the company have ethical standards, shareholder rights and strong Board governance?Sustainability refers to meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainable companies seek to create long-term value while minimising negative impacts on the environment and society. They strive to balance economic growth, social progress, and environmental responsibility.These terms are often used interchangeably. But what is the difference between them when sustainability and ESG professionals are talking about it? The following definitions come from\xa0MIT: ESG: “... is focused on screening companies for investments, largely by understanding how a business is affected by environment and social issues (with an additional focus on whether a company has good governance in place to manage those risks and pressures).”Sustainability: “… is a much broader idea, focusing on a company’s role in society, how it creates value by managing its environmental and social impacts (both positive and negative), and how its actions affect a long range of stakeholders.”CSR stands for Corporate Social Responsibility. It refers to a company's responsibility to be socially accountable to its stakeholders. CSR encompasses a wide range of qualitative activities, including philanthropy, volunteerism, and ethical business practices which may or may not be quantified by a business.The European Commission has defined CSR as the responsibility of enterprises for their impact on society and, therefore, it should be company-led. Companies can become socially responsible by:integrating social, environmental, ethical, consumer, and human rights concerns into their business strategy and operationsfollowing the lawPublic authorities play a supporting role through voluntary policy measures and, where necessary, complementary regulation.ESG, sustainability, and CSR are interrelated concepts, but they have distinct differences.CSR is a qualitative, self-regulated approach that is not directly related to financial performance and business valuation. It is implemented through corporate culture, values, and brand management and aims to provide a broader benefit to society.ESG is\xa0a quantitative, externally regulated approach that is directly related to financial performance and business valuation. It is implemented through measurable goals and audits and influences investors' decisions.Sustainability combines both qualitative and quantitative approaches, is both self and externally regulated and is usually related to financial performance and business valuation. It is implemented through a combination of CSR and ESG practices, and it aims to achieve resilient business operations and growth over the long term.Understanding the differences between these concepts is important for businesses to adopt practices that can benefit both the environment and society while creating long-term value for their stakeholders.Incorporating ESG, sustainability, and CSR practices is essential for companies looking to make a positive impact on society and the environment while creating long-term value for stakeholders. Sustainability is a broader concept that focuses on a company's role in society and managing its environmental and social impacts. CSR is a more defined term, but as ESG reporting becomes more mandated globally, it is increasingly being less used by businesses. ESG provides a more structured approach to reporting, with specific metrics and actual impact on a company's financial report taking centre stage. However, it is the act of being sustainable that is driving organisations to implement change.The Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) has made a significant impact in the sustainable finance sphere since its introduction in 2021. This regulation, which officially came into effect on March 10, 2021, requires all financial market participants in the European Union (EU) to report Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) disclosures, with additional requirements for products that promote ESG characteristics or that have sustainable investment objectives.There is a lot of discussion about what SFDR means for financial firms and ESG reporting. Our team of industry experts has written the following article, addressing the key points and meaningful deadlines of the regulation that businesses should be aware of.SFDR is part of an extensive ESG-based set of regulations implemented by the EU. The principal aim of this legislation is to redirect capital flow towards sustainable finance. Another key objective of SFDR is to prevent ‘greenwashing’ and provide transparency on sustainability within the financial market to ensure that financial market participants (FMPs) are able to embed sustainability into decision-making.Transparency is a vital aspect of this legislation, as it focuses on how providers of financial products manage and reduce sustainability risks. There are specifications at both entity and product levels. Specifically, the SFDR establishes and implements transparency criteria for financial commodity characteristics, allowing them to be compared based on their sustainability level.The SFDR regulation applies to FMPs such as investment firms, pension funds, asset managers, insurance companies, banks, venture capital funds, credit institutions offering portfolio management, or financial advisors. FMPs with fewer than 500 employees are not captured under the SFDR (although under the ‘comply-or-explain’ principle they are obligated to explain why).FMPs in the EU are required to disclose information on both their sustainability practices (entity-level) and their financial products (product-level). If these FMPs’ financial products make sustainable investments, the manager is required to demonstrate how those investments abide by the regulation\'s ""do no significant harm"" policy.FMPs need to also report on their Principal Adverse Impacts (PAIs) at both an entity- and a product-level. There are 50 PAI sustainability indicators (some mandatory and some voluntary) covering a range of ESG issues including greenhouse gas emissions, human rights and waste management. The regulation guidance regarding the timing of the reporting requirements on these PAIs is complex, but the entity-level reporting framework for PAIs began as a ""comply or explain"" requirement, shifting to ""comply"" for large FMPs on June 30, 2021.When approaching the SFDR regulation, one of the initial steps is establishing which sections are\xa0relevant to your company and products. Then we suggest the following steps:Get to know the sustainability efforts and position of your business.Perform a gap analysis and risk assessment based on current ESG data, activities, and regulations (this will help you discover weak points and vulnerabilities).Establish what steps the company needs to take to ensure full compliance with SFDR.Begin building an SFDR approach tailored to your business.Develop a long-term strategy for implementing the sustainability risk policy, due diligence policy, remuneration policy, and communication tactics.Dec 31 2023: End of 3rd\xa0reference periodJune 30 2024: The FMP must complete disclosure with a historical (year-on-year) comparison.",unstructured

48,19/07/2023,39,18,"The non-financial, ESG, sustainability and CSR reporting landscape is constantly evolving. As regulatory sustainability reporting frameworks and investor requests increase, we see more and more companies adding to their commitments and establishing long-term global sustainability reporting strategies. The ability to provide assurance for sustainability risk management and ensure that the company has access to reliable data to report to business stakeholders has become one of the main focal points.Yet, deciding on a sustainability reporting software solution to support the ongoing management of sustainability and ESG data is often considered a process far more daunting than it really is. In this article, we break down how finding the right sustainability reporting software can support your company’s reporting and help you achieve your sustainability goals.Most companies are looking for sustainability reporting software because they are too reliant on overworked error-prone spreadsheets. The right sustainability reporting software will be one that eliminates data risks and allows for accurate data collection, calculation and management. Plus, your software provider should regularly update emissions factors and methodologies so you don’t have to worry about whether or not you are using the right calculation method.Spreadsheets are inherently more unstable compared to sustainability reporting software solutions, so there is a much higher likelihood of data corruption. This can pose a serious risk if you are reliant on Excel as your main data calculation tool, even if you do create regular backups. Software-as-a-Service platforms provide daily customer data backups and offsite storage in secure locations for longer retention.The monitoring of performance over time is essential to understand long-term risks and opportunities. With an increase in the setting of long-term goals and commitments, this is now more relevant than ever. To build and manage a long-term sustainability strategy, you need access to current and correct data for both now and in the future – not just a time-stamped data set.Using a central sustainability reporting software platform to collect and manage ESG data enables you and your stakeholders to assess performance data on an ongoing basis, rather than in one moment in time. By sending questionnaires directly to suppliers or stakeholders through a software solution, deadlines, flags and notifications can be set which means that users can be automatically alerted when it’s time to request updated information or address an expired document.The ability to access accurate and consistent sustainability and ESG data across an organisation to enable responsible business decisions is now more important than ever. Sustainability reporting software enables users to customise questionnaires and data collection to ensure they are collecting the right data. Once collected, the sustainability reporting software will enable them to aggregate consistent, comparable and accurate ESG performance data from across the organisation. It also enables users to run comparisons across locations, benchmark and view key information across various metrics and KPIs.Many companies are still using spreadsheets and emails and, as data gets more complex, these processes become cumbersome, time-consuming and prone to error. Manual processes are not only a security risk but are also prone to error and can be extremely heavy on time and resources.Through the use of sustainability reporting software, data collection, management and reporting can all be automated, on a large scale, which leaves users more time for analysis. Using software enables users to move their focus away from just data collection and to in-depth reporting, analysis and informed decision-making.Meeting the scope of internal and external reporting requirements, and reporting to different stakeholders, requires a wide range of analysis tools and reporting dashboards. The right sustainability reporting software will allow you to model, apportion and compare data in a way that is relevant to your company and its stakeholders. Additionally, it should provide the option to group data into unlimited customisable sets.As reporting requirements increase, so do the volume and scope of data that you need to manage. The sustainability reporting software you choose should be robust and flexible enough for your reporting both now, and in 5 years’ time, to enable you to achieve your long-term goals.When selecting software, think about whether the solution will evolve with your reporting requirements and adapt to your changing organisational structure in years to come. It is also important to consider how often the software is updated and whether the updates are charged at an additional cost.Continue reading: Key aspects to consider in sustainability reporting.At Royal Mail, our impact on the environment and society is very important to us.

49,06/07/2023,23,11,"The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) has taken a significant step towards promoting transparency and accountability in sustainability reporting with the issuance of its first-ever global sustainability disclosure standards. These standards, IFRS S1 and IFRS S2, mark the beginning of a new era in disclosing sustainability-related information in capital markets worldwide. By providing a common language for companies to communicate their climate-related risks and opportunities, the ISSB aims to enhance trust and confidence in corporate disclosures, thus empowering investors to make informed decisions.IFRS S1 establishes a set of disclosure requirements that enable companies to communicate sustainability-related risks and opportunities over the short, medium, and long term. The aim is to provide useful information to investors, facilitating a better understanding of how sustainability factors impact a company's prospects. IFRS S2 focuses specifically on climate-related disclosures and is designed to complement IFRS S1, ensuring a comprehensive approach to sustainability reporting. Both fully incorporate the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).The ISSB developed these standards in response to the growing demand for consistent and comparable sustainability-related disclosures. With extensive market feedback, the ISSB aims to establish a global baseline for reporting sustainability information. This move has gained the support of the G20, the Financial Stability Board, and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO).The official launch of the ISSB Standards was led by ISSB Chair Emmanuel Faber at the IFRS Foundation's annual conference 26-27 June 2023. At the event, Faber highlighted\xa0the significant role that these standards play in ensuring globally comparable information about sustainability-related risks and opportunities, which is crucial for investment decision-making.Now that IFRS S1 and IFRS S2 are issued, the ISSB plans to collaborate with jurisdictions and companies to support the adoption of these standards. To facilitate this process, the ISSB will establish a Transition Implementation Group and launch capacity-building initiatives to aid effective implementation. Moreover, the ISSB is open to working with jurisdictions interested in additional disclosures beyond the global baseline and partnering with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) to ensure efficient and effective reporting when combining the ISSB Standards with other reporting frameworks.Various influential leaders and organisations have praised the ISSB's initiative.Erkki Liikanen, Chair of the IFRS Foundation Trustees, said:Jean-Paul Servais, Chair of the International Organization of Securities Commission (IOSCO), said:The endorsements from diverse stakeholders support the importance of these standards in driving sustainable value creation.The release of IFRS S1 and IFRS S2 by the International Sustainability Standards Board signifies a significant milestone in advancing sustainability reporting worldwide. By establishing a common language for disclosing climate-related risks and opportunities, these standards enhance transparency, accountability, and comparability in corporate sustainability reporting.

The country has also committed to a Climate Plan which includes reducing GHG emissions to net zero by 2050.This article aims to provide an overview of the ESG reporting landscape in South Africa and outline current and upcoming reporting requirements for organisations.The growing trend of a more robust approach to ESG reporting is driven by an increasing awareness of the need to address the environmental and social impact of business activities and investments, as well as the importance of managing climate risks and opportunities.Governments around the world are setting more stringent reporting requirements to ensure companies are transparent about their sustainability practices, while businesses are recognising the benefits of disclosing ESG data to attract investors and customers who are increasingly seeking out responsible and sustainable investments. Consumers are also becoming more conscious of the impact of their purchasing decisions on the environment and society and are demanding more accountability from companies.The past few years have been very formative when it comes to the ESG reporting landscape in South Africa, especially due to the increasing demand for transparent and accurate reporting on ESG factors. The country's regulations, including the\xa0Johannesburg Stock Exchange's (JSE) ESG reporting requirements, have set standards for companies to disclose their ESG risks and opportunities.The JSE is developing Sustainability Disclosure Guidance, including a Climate Change Disclosure Guidance specifically tailored to the South African context. These guidelines aim to assist JSE-listed companies, institutional investors, and other stakeholders in understanding the climate crisis, identifying risks and opportunities, and linking sustainability disclosures to value creation.South African companies are being urged to take action on sustainability because it will be mandated by local and international regulators such as the JSE, the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), as well as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), among others.Considering the connection of South Africa companies to global markets through commodities and capital markets, and the convergence in ESG standards, companies in South Africa should expect mandatory reporting on ESG issues to be just around the corner, and they should prepare.The South African Reserve Bank (SARB), the central bank of South Africa, has implemented several significant changes to promote ESG reporting and a formal ESG disclosure framework is expected imminently. The bank has instructed financial institutions under its supervision to enhance their resilience against climate risks, ahead of new updates on the JSE’s Sustainability and Climate Disclosure Guidance due to be published in 2023.SARB is advocating a 'hybrid model' of reporting that incorporates both traditional financial reporting and sustainability reporting. SARB has announced that it expects its institutions to identify and disclose material climate-related information to stakeholders, and include this information in their disclosure frameworks. SARB adds that the\xa0Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\xa0could serve as an important guideline in this respect.SARB is also taking into account the financial implications of climate-related shocks, and has announced plans to incorporate climate change indicators, disclosure and taxonomy rules into the prudential framework.South Africa is increasing access to sustainable finance and stimulating the allocation of capital to support a development-focused and climate-resilient economy with the recent publication of\xa0South Africa’s first Green Finance Taxonomy\xa0by National Treasury. Following a two-year consultation and development process, South Africa’s first national Green Finance Taxonomy was launched in 2022 by the Taxonomy Working Group, as part of South Africa’s Sustainable Finance Initiative.The Green Finance Taxonomy is a classification system or catalogue that defines a minimum set of assets, projects, activities and sectors that are eligible to be defined as ""green"" in line with international best practice and national priorities. It is designed for investors, issuers, lenders and other financial sector participants to track, monitor, and demonstrate the credentials of their green activities in a more confident and efficient way. It classifies economic activities according to two objectives: making substantial contributions to climate change adaptation, and making substantial contributions to climate change mitigation.The Taxonomy is intended to have a range of benefits. Amongst other things:Helps the financial sector with clarity and certainty in selecting green investments in line with international best practice and South Africa’s national policies and priorities.Reduces financial sector risks through enhanced management of environmental and social performance.Reduces the costs associated with labelling and issuing green financial instrument.Unlock significant investment opportunities for South Africa in a broad range of green and climate-friendly assets.Supports regulatory and supervision oversight of the financial sector.Provides a basis for regulators to align or reference green financial products.This Taxonomy is essential to provide guidance to investors on sustainable investment opportunities and ensure businesses are held accountable for their impact on the environment and society. The SA Green Finance Taxonomy is similar to the\xa0EU Taxonomy\xa0as both pursue climate ambition of a net-zero economy to 2050 as a core environmental objective.In addition to the growing focus on sustainable finance and disclosure, there are also significant efforts being made towards building\xa0climate-resilient infrastructure and promoting sustainable land planning.The Cities Support Programme (CSP), located within the inter-governmental relations (IGR) division of the National Treasury (NT) of South Africa, focuses on building metro capability to efficiently plan, finance, implement, and maintain climate resilient projects and programs. By improving cities' capacity for infrastructure delivery and full life-cycle asset management, the CSP aims to unlock investments needed for the transformation of South African cities into more compact, inclusive, productive, and sustainable spaces.These efforts align with the National Development Plan's emphasis on establishing a competitive infrastructure base to promote investment, trade, and job creation. Through targeted interventions and the integration of climate resilience and sustainability in metro planning, financing, and delivery of capital projects, the CSP aims to strengthen cities' role in the national climate change response. This will ultimately enhance city resilience, response to climate change, and foster inclusive economic growth.It is essential that businesses understand the impact of their activities on the environment and society. It is no longer sufficient to focus solely on financial performance; investors and stakeholders now demand that companies adopt sustainable practices that consider the long-term impact of their operations.South Africa's regulations, including the Johannesburg Stock Exchange's ESG reporting requirements and the Green Finance Taxonomy, have set standards for companies to disclose their ESG risks and opportunities. By collecting and reporting data accurately, companies in South Africa can not only meet regulatory requirements but also enhance their reputation and competitiveness. Furthermore, accurate reporting can provide investors and stakeholders with insights into a company's sustainability practices, allowing them to make informed decisions and hold companies accountable for their ESG performance.Finally, to stay prepared for evolving regulations and ensure compliance, companies should also stay up to date with the latest\xa0sustainability issues\xa0and developments. Staying informed of sustainability framework and regulations allows companies to proactively address environmental and social risks, seize opportunities for sustainable growth, and align with emerging regulatory requirements.Greenstone has partnered with Bidvest Facilities Management in South Africa to support South African companies on their ESG reporting journey. A member of Bidvest Group, and an industry leader in South Africa, Bidvest FM provides environmental sustainability solutions to enable its clients to address business requirements, targets and commitments. Through this collaboration, Bidvest FM is able to offer Greenstone’s ESG reporting software solutions to its clients to enable them to collect, manage, analyse and report the data required to monitor and disclose ESG performance with accuracy and confidence.",unstructured
51,21/06/2023,58,35,"'The Canadian Parliament has recently announced the enactment of Bill S-211, also known as ""The Fighting Against Forced Labour and Child Labour in Supply Chains Act"". This legislation aims to prevent and reduce the risks of forced labour and child labour in supply chains, with immediate implications for Canadian businesses and importers.Bill S-211 presents a proposal to establish a public reporting framework that would require various government institutions and private sector entities to submit annual reports. These reports would outline the measures taken in the previous fiscal year to prevent and mitigate the use of forced labour and child labour in the production of goods, both domestically and internationally, by the entity or goods imported into Canada by the entity.Depending on the size and complexity of an entity’s supply chain, adhering to the proposed legislation could be quite burdensome. Using technology like Greenstone’s SupplierPortal to collect, manage and report the data required for this type of regulation enables businesses to streamline processes, ensure compliance and engage supply chains in sustainability and ESG initiatives.Reporting obligations apply to various entities, including: Canadian federal government institutions, departments, and Crown corporations, along with their subsidiaries. Additionally, the reporting obligations extend to private sector entities meeting the following criteria:Involved in producing, selling, or distributing goods within Canada or elsewhere.Importing goods produced outside of Canada.Exercising control over an entity engaged in the activities mentioned in points (1) or (2).Control is broadly defined and encompasses direct or indirect control or common control in any manner.Entity refers to corporations, trusts, partnerships, or other unincorporated organisations meeting any of the following conditions:Listed on a Canadian stock exchange.Having a place of business, conducting business, or possessing assets in Canada, and, based on consolidated financial statements, the entity satisfies at least two of the following criteria for one of its two most recent financial years:Possessing at least C$20 million in assets.Generating at least C$40 million in revenue.Employing an average of at least 250 employees.Falling under other prescribed regulations, which are yet to be enacted.The private sector annual reports mandated by Bill S-211 require the inclusion of the following information for each entity covered by the report, subject to approval by the entity's governing bodyStructure, activities, and supply chains of the entity.Policies and due diligence processes regarding forced labour and child labour.Identification of business areas and supply chains carrying risks of forced labour or child labour, along with steps taken to assess and manage those risks.Measures implemented to remediate instances of forced labour or child labour.Efforts to mitigate the loss of income to vulnerable families resulting from actions taken to eliminate forced labour or child labour from the entity's activities and supply chains.Training provided to employees regarding forced labour and child labour.The entity's assessment of effectiveness in ensuring the absence of forced labour and child labour in its business and supply chains.Similar content requirements apply to reporting obligations for government institutions.Child labour refers to labour or services provided or offered to be provided by individuals under 18 years of age under circumstances contrary to Canadian laws, mentally, physically, socially, or morally dangerous to them, interfering with their schooling, or constituting the worst forms of child labour as defined in Article 3 of the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999.Forced labour refers to labour or services provided or offered to be provided by individuals under circumstances where they reasonably believe their safety or the safety of someone known to them would be threatened if they refuse to provide or offer the labour or service. It also includes forced or compulsory labour as defined in Article 2 of the Forced Labour Convention, 1930.The bill expands the existing import ban under Canada\'s Customs Tariff to include goods that are ""mined, manufactured or produced wholly or in part"" with ""child labour,"" in addition to goods produced with ""forced labour"" and ""prison labour,"" which are already prohibited.Bill S-211 passed the Senate on April 28, 2022, and has also passed third reading in the House of Commons on May 3, 2023. The Fighting Against Forced Labour and Child Labour in Supply Chains Act, as outlined in Bill S-211, will come into effect on January 1 of the year following its receipt of Royal Assent. In the case of receiving Royal Assent in 2023, the law will take effect on January 1, 2024, with the first report deadline for reporting entities set for May 31, 2024, with the expectation for reports to be submitted to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness by May 31 each year.Entities or individuals failing to comply with the obligations outlined in the Fighting Against Forced Labour and Child Labour in Supply Chains Act or providing false or misleading statements or information to the Minister, such as in an annual report, may face summary conviction with fines up to $250,000. In conclusion, integrating supply chain transparency into an organisation's Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) framework is crucial for both good business practice and adherence to pending legislation. Companies must establish effective governance structures to identify and mitigate risks, particularly related to forced labour and child labour. For companies meeting the reporting entity thresholds outlined earlier, it is advisable to assess and enhance their supply chain due diligence and monitoring practices in preparation for the reporting requirements set to commence in May 2024. Greenstone works with its clients to build long-term supplier management processes that address and reduce risk, both now and in the future. We recognise that clients are on a journey and therefore the requirements change over time, particularly as a result of external factors such as regulation.",unstructured
52,14/06/2023,50,33,"The Science Based Targets Network has introduced the world's first science-based targets for nature.  This development establishes a significant standard, driving corporate actions towards ambitious and quantifiable action on nature. As the business landscape undergoes a transformation, it becomes necessary to understand the significance of this new guidance.  When should businesses embark on their journey? What does the process entail? This comprehensive article aims to be a resource, covering everything you need to know. At the forefront of the Science Based Targets Network stands the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), a partnership between organisations including CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute (WRI), and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). The SBTi plays a central role in defining and promoting best practice in emissions reductions and net-zero targets in line with climate science.  As companies will starting setting science-based targets for nature, the SBTi provides technical assistance and expert resources.  Through the expertise of its team, the SBTi provides independent assessment and validation of targets. The SBTi played a decisive role as the lead partner in the Business Ambition for 1. 5°C campaign, a global coalition of UN agencies, business leaders, and industry pioneers.  This initiative encouraged companies worldwide to establish net-zero science-based targets aligned with a future limited to 1. 5°C of warming. Science-based targets provide a clearly defined pathway for companies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, helping prevent the worst impacts of climate change and future-proof business growth. These targets are considered 'science-based' when they align with the latest insights from climate science, representing the necessary measures to achieve the objectives outlined in the Paris Agreement.  This includes limiting global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and diligently pursuing endeavours to restrict warming to 1. 5°C. The Science Based Targets Network (SBTN) is a collaborative alliance of global non-profits and mission-driven organisations dedicated to equipping companies and cities with the necessary guidance to establish science-based targets for all of Earth's systems.  By providing clear direction, the SBTN empowers companies to address their impacts and dependencies on nature throughout their value chains, establishing a well-defined pathway towards sustainability. Building on the momentum generated by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), the SBTN comprises over 45 organisations, including those already involved in the SBTi, diligently developing methods and resources for science-based targets for nature in the corporate sphere, and science-based targets for both climate and nature in urban environments. The Science Based Targets for Nature aim to guide companies in addressing their environmental impacts across freshwater, land, biodiversity, ocean, and climate, and provide a framework for measurable and comparable corporate action on nature conservation. Building upon the established foundation of climate targets set by more than 2,600 companies through the Science Based Targets Initiative, these nature-focused targets offer guidance on how organizations can contribute to the realization of an equitable, net-zero, and nature-positive future.  This will form a key part of progress towards Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and global policy milestones. The Science Based Targets for Nature include a 5-step process for putting science into action.  As part of this first release the Science Based Targets Network has developed detailed technical guidance for the first 3 steps of the process with additional guidance on the final steps (Act and Track) coming in 2024. In the assessment step, companies evaluate their value chain-wide impacts on nature and identify potential environmental impacts and locations for target setting.  This involves using sector-level materiality screening tools and assessing impacts throughout the value chain. The prioritisation step involves identifying locations and activities that require target setting and prioritising areas for action based on overall impact and feasibility. In the target-setting step, companies collect baseline data for priority targets and locations.  Targets are then set for freshwater, land, and climate, with biodiversity partially covered within freshwater and land targets.  The targets are expected to be disclosed publicly, and the validation process for targets is currently being piloted. The fourth step, ""Act,"" involves taking action based on science-based targets.  While the specific methodologies and tools for this step are still in development, companies can follow the SBTN Action Framework, which includes actions such as avoidance, reduction, restoration, regeneration, and transformation. The final step is to track progress, adapt strategies if needed, and report progress publicly.  High-level measurement guidance is available for companies starting now, with detailed Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) guidance to be provided in 2024. The Science Based Targets Network strives to establish a streamlined process for companies to set targets that drive progress towards multiple sustainability objectives simultaneously.  To facilitate this integration, SBTN offers insights into the connections between its methods and other widely recognised sustainability frameworks, standards, and regulations.  This approach enables companies to understand how science-based targets for nature support and complement other related frameworks. While science-based targets for nature generally surpass the ambition of current policy frameworks, in cases where exceptions arise, SBTN encourages companies to adopt more rigorous targets aligned with the science-based indicators for freshwater and land and submit them for validation. SBTN's documentation includes references to other relevant organisations such as the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), the Taskforce on Nature-Related Financial Disclosure (TNFD), the Accountability Framework Initiative (AFi), the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS), the Natural Capital Protocol (NCP), the Biological Diversity Protocol (BDP), the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), CDP, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), United Nations (UN), International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO), ESRS/EFRAG, and emerging EU requirements. It's important to note that SBTN methods complement but do not supersede the guidance and requirements provided by SBTi, particularly concerning the assessment of greenhouse gas impacts across all material value chain activities. The Science Based Targets Network aims to combat biodiversity loss by ensuring companies contribute to the protection, restoration, and sustainable use of natural ecosystems.  The current release of science-based targets for nature directly addresses key drivers of biodiversity loss. In Step 1, companies assess their environmental impacts against five drivers identified by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, using biodiversity data to contextualize them. Step 2\xa0integrates biodiversity into spatial prioritisation for target setting, focusing on urgent conservation areas. Step 3\xa0methods tackle biodiversity pressures.  While species-specific targets are not included yet, the land and freshwater methods address dominant drivers like land use change, habitat loss, and overexploitation of freshwater resources.

53,07/06/2023,86,40,"For both businesses and investors, sustainability reporting is becoming increasingly crucial as global awareness of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues continues to rise. However, although sustainability and ESG reporting is on the rise globally, many companies are still struggling to access accurate data and report on sustainability aspects that are material to their business.. This article is dedicated to sustainability reporting and covers topics such as: Is your sustainability data accessible? How to make sustainability reporting work for your business and how to improve transparency in your sustainability reporting.. If you’re involved in sustainability reporting, data is arguably at the heart of it all. Many organisations are faced with a lot of data and this is only going to increase. If your data isn’t organised properly or you aren’t able to effectively analyse the data you are collecting, then it is going to be a struggle for you to communicate how you measure up against your goals and strategy. With the right supporting data, it will make it much easier for you to share your stories and successes.. Spreadsheets are the necessary evil of any sustainability professional, offering a required repository for huge volumes of data but for storing it in a complex and lifeless way. Breathing life into this sustainability data and making it talk to you is what organisations are now waking up to and realising the power of their internal big data and why data should be material and robust.. Making data accessible means it has to be easily retrieved, interpreted and acted upon by different organisational stakeholders. A single piece of data can hold a plethora of reporting opportunities and its value varies according to which audience it’s for.. For example, an organisation’s annual electricity consumption is a valuable environmental KPI. However, whereas for an employee it may be communicated at a granular office level as part of a behaviour change competition related to energy savings, for suppliers, information about their contribution to the overall impact is much more valuable. Clients and consumers may care more about the environmental (e.g. CO?, resources or natural capital) impacts of the energy consumed and shareholders/investors might want to know whether a green electricity supplier or renewable energy certificate (REC) is associated and being reported to frameworks such as CDP.. Sustainability data is used to tell stories, set targets and report trends. But many aspects can affect your sustainability strategy. Being aware of these factors and including them in your plan, will help you build a successful sustainability strategy.. 1– Have the right data to measure the success of your sustainability plans. If you’re not measuring what is happening, then it’s hard to know if you’re meeting your goals. To support your overall sustainability strategy, you need a clear idea of what is going on throughout the organisation, regardless of your size or geography.. In short, this means:. Deciding which data sets you to need to monitor and recordHaving a robust process in place to collect this data across the organisation consistently. 2 – Support and commitment of senior management. Successful sustainability strategies often rely on support from senior management. This can manifest itself in several ways, including:. Providing the resource and budget to help turn plans into a realityEmbedding sustainability into the company’s overall strategy, so that it is not just seen as an optional extraA confirmed commitment by the company leadership to sustainability. 3– Flexibility within the organisation. When it comes to sustainability strategy, knowledge is often held with a limited number of individuals. This isn’t necessarily a problem. But, as companies grow and employees change, this can lead to knowledge being diluted. . Having a broader understanding of sustainability processes and strategy within the organisation helps to make the organisation more resilient to change. It also means that time isn’t wasted having to recreate the wheel if key individuals leave the company.. 4 – Embed sustainability into the overall business strategy. Being able to entrench your sustainability strategy within the business strategy and values is an important hurdle to overcome. Failure to do so can limit the effectiveness of your strategy. If it is not perceived as business-critical, then it can become more difficult to secure the necessary budget and support to make your strategy a success. There are clear tangible and intangible values that can be improved with a successful sustainability strategy, including:. Brand value and positioningImproved revenue generationRisk reductionCost reduction. Communicating these benefits to internal and external stakeholders is a key factor to embedding sustainability into the organisation. Also, having a clear vision for your sustainability strategy will give coherence and direction to the work you are doing.. It is tempting when working through a reporting cycle to use it as an opportunity to talk retrospectively about all the work that has happened in the last year. But it is also a chance to consider the opportunities that are arising in your business and review how these will support your sustainability strategy in the year ahead. Use it as a time to review your sustainability strategy, questioning whether it is still the right approach for your organisation.. Goals will move you forward. While your strategy will provide you with the approach that you want to take, your goals will give you the primary outcomes that you want to achieve and the timeframe to achieve these. After you have set these goals, share them with the relevant stakeholders. That way it is easy for people to grasp what you want to achieve and help you to direct engagement both internally and externally to the business.. Once your goals are set, you have to decide how you are going to measure against them. How do you get the information you need to be transparent about your progress? How do you communicate this with your stakeholders? The specifics of how you measure and what you measure will depend on the goals you are trying to achieve. But, what is important here, is taking this information and communicating it clearly to your stakeholders.",unstructured
54,31/05/2023,32,16,"ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) is now commonplace for examining and disclosing an organisation\'s sustainability and social impact. However, the ""G"" in ESG - information relating to how an organisation is governed - is often overlooked in ESG reporting. In this article, we explore the “G” in ESG and outline why it is fundamental to all other aspects of the organisation's sustainability.Governance refers to an organisation's internal policies and practices, leadership structure, compliance, and overall decision-making processes. The purpose of the corporation, the role and makeup of boards of directors, and the compensation and oversight of top executives have emerged as core issues in companies’ corporate governance structures.Good governance is essential for long-term success. When an organisation has strong governance, it is more likely to make sound decisions, maintain the trust of its stakeholders, and create value. On the other hand, organisations with weak governance are more likely to face financial losses, reputational damage, and regulatory violations.Regulators, investors, customers and employees are increasingly interested in organisations with strong ESG values and practices, including good governance, transparency and accountability, and appropriate risk management. Studies have shown that companies with strong ESG performance outperform their peers. So, organisations will see tremendous benefits if they prioritise good governance as part of a strong ESG strategy.One crucial element of good governance is risk management. Organisations need to have a procedure in place to identify, assess, and manage risk. This process will include risks related to the environment, social responsibility, and regulatory compliance. Proactively addressing these risks will reduce the likelihood and impact of threats while increasing the ability to take advantage of opportunities.Organisations that are transparent about their operations, financials, and decision-making processes are more likely to earn the trust of stakeholders, including investors, customers, and employees. Transparency also helps prevent corruption and unethical behaviour by making it easier to detect and report. A strong culture of good governance backed by appropriate tools and championed by all leaders is essential to providing this transparency.Finally, good governance requires ethical behaviour and compliance with relevant laws and regulations. Organisations prioritising profits over ethics are more likely to engage in illegal or unethical practices that harm stakeholders and damage the company's reputation. Organisations must have clear policies and procedures to ensure compliance with laws and regulations and hold board members and the executive team accountable for ethical behaviour.Achieving good governance requires a firm commitment from the board and leadership team, but it also needs the right tools to become embedded and implemented. Tools which improve the efficiency of meetings, capture decisions and actions, provide simple overviews of progress towards goals and compliance and which simplify and promote the practice of risk management.Increasingly organisations are investing in specialist software to support their governance framework replacing the complex spreadsheets, file stores, email chains and other inefficient and ineffective tools they previously used.In conclusion, the ""G"" in ESG is crucial when evaluating an organisation\'s impact on the world. Good governance is vital for an organisation\'s long-term success and includes risk management, decision-making, transparency, compliance, and ethical behaviour. Organisations with strong governance practices promote sustainable, compliant, and ethical business practices while benefiting from increased value and positive financial returns.",unstructured
55,24/05/2023,57,34,"Sustainability has become an increasingly important topic in recent years, with businesses recognising the need to address their impact on the environment and society. As a result, sustainability is now relevant to all aspects of an organisation's operation, and companies are starting to integrate sustainable practices into their supply chain. However, embedding sustainability into a company's culture is a significant undertaking that requires a strategic approach.In this article, we will outline five practical tips that businesses can take to start the process of embedding sustainability into their supply chain.Identify which supply chain related regulations affect your companyThe first step is to identify which regulations and standards apply to your company. This includes country-specific legislation, as well as any voluntary commitments. Companies must also understand which areas of their business are affected by these regulations and which are responsible for compliance.In February 2022, the European Commission issued its proposal for a Directive on Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence (CSDD), aiming to encourage ethical and sustainable business practices throughout all global value chains. These new regulations will provide companies with legal security and increase transparency for investors and consumers. Learn more about this mandate here.2. Create and assess suppliers against a code of conduct Companies must develop a code of conduct that aligns with their corporate strategy and legislative requirements. This code should be used to assess suppliers, and supplier attestation should be mandatory in the supplier selection process. Live compliance statistics should be recorded.The UN Global Compact (UNGC) is a United Nations initiative to encourage responsible business.\xa0Supply chain sustainability can be applied through its 10 principles, covering human rights, labour, the environment, and anti-corruption. The UNGC recommends embedding the 10 principles into a supplier code of conduct. Organisations should identify relevant impact areas based on their sector, and tailor supplier codes of conduct accordingly. Once a supplier code of conduct has been established to reflect areas material to a company’s sustainability reporting and business risk, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) provides a framework to allow organisations to measure and report on key impact or risk areas.3. Develop a consistent approach for more responsible supplier assessment Companies should develop a consistent approach to supplier assessment that is based on global reporting frameworks such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This approach should also include cross-business compliance requirements such as risk, legal, sustainability, health and safety, and information security.The sustainable procurement landscape is constantly evolving. Businesses reporting their sustainability performance can refer to or use a variety of international and national frameworks, standards and guidelines such as CDP, GRI, SASB, and the SDGs. Get the latest industry updates and learn more about the available sustainability frameworks and standards to support your company's reporting here.4. Utilise assessment informationCompanies should utilise the assessment information to identify non-compliances and communicate them to the relevant business areas and suppliers. Performance metrics should be used to embed sustainability in supplier selection and review processes. The driver for this could be to ensure a supplier’s ability to deliver services to you, for example by having the correct certification in place. Or it could be that you require further information from particularly high-risk suppliers.Ideally, the chosen solution should enable you to store this information against all of your supplier records so that it can be accessed across the organisation. If it does not then you should look at ways to ensure that the key information from supplier responses is made available either through integration or internal processes.5. Create a deeper supplier review or audit processFinally, companies should create a deeper supplier review or audit process that links further assessment to the review process. High-risk or poor-performing suppliers should drive deeper assessments or audits. This is also an opportunity to work through improvement plans with suppliers. These steps are by no means exhaustive, but they will help any organisation to begin to work more coherently and to have more confidence in their supply chain. At Greenstone, we work through these early stages with our clients to create a compliance-based approach to supplier assessment and management. Then, as your organisation becomes more mature you can start to work with suppliers more closely and embed sustainability in all purchasing decisions.Greenstone’s SupplierPortal solution supports our clients throughout this journey, from a simple starting point right through to a fully integrated approach.As such, the goal of your strategy should not only be to reach a point where short-term risk is minimised, supplier compliance maximised, and sustainable selection criteria are used, but to also have the confidence and maturity to be focussed on the long-term risks and opportunities.",unstructured
56,17/05/2023,92,43,"Supply chains are dynamic. And increasingly, they're complex and global. This means suppliers can come from anywhere in the world and the risks associated with each supplier relationship can differ significantly. To manage the risks that companies face from their supply chain, they need to put a clear strategy in place to ensure they know how their suppliers are performing when it comes to aspects such as standards, conduct, compliance and ESG requirements. This article aims to help organisations plan a strategy and process for the collection, management, analysis and reporting of supplier data. It’s no secret that there is more data in the world than ever before. But have you ever wondered whether you are gathering the right compliance information from your suppliers? What compliance data do you need to collect from your suppliers? It doesn’t matter if you are starting to collect information about your suppliers or refining an existing process, it is important to establish the data you need to collect. With so much information available, you’ll need to decide which topics, questions and documentation are most valuable to you and your organisation. The specific information can vary, depending on your industry, relevant legislative requirements and your organisation’s sustainability strategy. But, by understanding the data you need, you can tailor your supplier questionnaires to get the right information. How are you going to manage your suppliers’ responses? After you have decided what data you need to collect from your suppliers, it’s time to decide how to manage it. The volume of data you have from your suppliers can quickly become unmanageable, without the right system in place. For example, if you are relying on spreadsheets, you can find yourself with thousands of responses, across multiple spreadsheets, and in incomparable formats. An additional problem that organisations can face, is having different questionnaire responses held by different parts of the business. This can result in a poor understanding of overall supplier compliance, therefore increasing the risk to the business Having a tool to manage your supplier data will help you overcome these challenges, and ensure that you’re getting answers from your data.  How are you going to engage with your suppliers? Suppliers are being asked for similar information, in different formats, from numerous customers. This burden that is being placed on suppliers can jeopardise the response rate to your requests for information and dramatically increase the time spent chasing suppliers. The more you can do to standardise the information gathered across your sector, the easier it will be to engage your suppliers. Secondly, by moving to an online solution you will simplify the process for suppliers and, with the right tool, make it more efficient and empower each supplier to proactively use their data. By making the process as simple as possible for your suppliers, you also make it more straightforward for you. Collecting the supplier data you need is the first step to managing a supplier relationship. In fact, for many organisations, supplier data is a key source of information to inform key strategic business decisions. But, while many organisations currently collect data from their suppliers, the processes that they have in place are not always robust. Many rely on offline, manual approaches, which are time-consuming and inefficient. Here’s why your business can benefit from a structured process. Engagement makes data collection easier and more manageable Gathering the data you need to make informed decisions can be a challenge, even when it's just within your own company. Expanding this out to your suppliers can make it even harder to get the data you need.Your suppliers may well be apprehensive about sharing their data with you. But having a clear and properly structured plan for engaging with your suppliers means that you can mitigate their worries, while also highlighting the benefits. Look for opportunities where you can use your data collection process to help your suppliers, as it will mean they are more likely to share their data with you.  It’s an opportunity for you to complete a detailed analysis of your suppliers Thinking of collecting data from your suppliers as just a tick box exercise means you are missing opportunities to complete in-depth analysis and gain a deeper understanding of what is going on with your suppliers. While a large part of engaging with your suppliers will involve collecting data, going beyond this means that you can monitor for compliance and understand any potential risks. This will make it easier for you to identify any potential problems with your suppliers and react to them before they become business-critical. It can help make life easier for your suppliers Imagine this situation, you’re a supplier and every single one of your customers requires its own set of data. Suddenly you have to respond to potentially hundreds of data requests. This means duplication of effort and a time-consuming, repetitive process. Instead, if they were using a central online repository of all information that buyers want, it would mean that suppliers can reduce the manual input needed to recreate this information. They can use this system to share information with multiple buyers. Many factors continue to keep supply chain sustainability at the forefront of debate and it's important that organisations not just monitor, but account for and manage risk. Here’s how you can begin to understand the risks in your supply chain.What are the risks in your supply chain that you need to understand? This means looking at a variety of the risks that suppliers can present, including environmental and social. Companies that are reporting to various CSR frameworks, have to consider environmental impacts and\xa0supply chain\xa0risks. As part of CDP, for example, you report on the climate change risks for your organisation. Within GRI, you report on environmental impacts, including supplier environmental impacts and environmental assessments in the supply chain.  Therefore, if your suppliers are working in countries where there are climate change risks around, say flooding, or if you're working with raw materials, and those raw materials are at threat of depletion, then that's a business risk to the organisation. But there's also an environmental impact there that needs to be considered in terms of how your suppliers interact with nature, natural capital and ecosystem services to then provide their supplier services to you. There is also social pressure to consider. There are a lot of instances where companies have been in the media because of their supply chain issues, particularly in areas such as textiles and clothing. You've got organisations that have been thrown into the media spotlight around this, which has put social pressure on them to get a better handle on where their supply chain impacts are. Better than a reactionary approach to negative incidents is a process of proactive engagement with suppliers.How can you ensure you get relevant information from all your suppliers? In a lot of instances, organisations will already be asking the right questions or have most of the right questions. But because so much time is spent on gathering the information using an offline process, time to focus on the analysis of supply chain impacts is compromised. The traditional time constraints that are associated with collecting supplier information mean that organisations will tend to focus on their top-tier suppliers - the top 10 or maybe the top 20 whom they have a good relationship with. But there needs to be a fundamental shift, so the process of gathering all of this information can expand to cover the whole supplier base. A key part of this success is having really good relationships and contacts with your suppliers. It's no good trying to send questionnaires to info@companyX because you're likely to be ignored. Nurturing contacts and engaging all suppliers means you can get down to those smaller suppliers that you might not have necessarily considered before and ensure that you are investigating potential risks in all parts of your supply chain. This isn’t necessarily the suppliers you're spending the most money with because sometimes the organisations you are spending less with can incur more operational risk involved when you’re dealing with them. In particular, those smaller ones that you might be spending less money on, particularly SMEs, in some ways, are more likely to need help with these areas of risk. The larger players that you're spending a lot of money with, are often large buyers themselves and therefore more likely to have the internal processes in place to understand and mitigate the risk in their supply chain.Managing supplier relationships is no longer just about driving long term derived value from your supply chain. Companies are increasingly facing challenges that require them to proactively innovate how they manage the key stakeholders in their supply chains. In some areas, by outlasting the competition, you can grow your business significantly. No matter how big or small, it’s becoming essential for businesses to keep informed and up to date with modern standards and legislation affecting supplier management operations. The influence of environmental factors on supplier relationships As a starting point, complying with legal requirements is a minimum. For most, if not all, organisations it is essential to have a constant flow of information from their suppliers, to make sure that even legally compliant organisations are not acting in a way that introduces risk. For example, even if a supplier is legally compliant, their operations can still be affected by an increased risk of flooding (or similar). Organisations, therefore, need to understand who will hold the liability, if any disruptions occur as a result of environmental factors and have the necessary data to support this. External pressure on organisations News stories get shared faster than ever before, which can lead to an uncomfortable level of transparency for some organisations. On top of this, individual companies can be targeted by social campaigners. These are people looking to influence and change a company’s approach to its supplier management. For example, it might be that a supplier is fully compliant with local requirements, but this is a different or lower standard to one expected. As a result, the buying organisation comes under social pressure to change or reform its supplier relationship to meet the required level. Pressure coming from investors  Alongside the risks of environmental and social factors, there is growing pressure from the investor community. Investors are increasingly interested in business sustainability performance and also the benefits that can come from investing in forward-thinking organisations. Not having the evidence to prove to investors that due diligence on suppliers is being conducted could mean potential investors are less willing to commit, without the assurances they increasingly require.",unstructured
57,10/05/2023,71,43,"Sustainability reporting has become increasingly important for companies as stakeholders demand greater transparency and accountability on ESG issues. Materiality is a key concept in sustainability reporting, as it helps companies identify the most important sustainability issues to report on, and provides stakeholders with more meaningful and relevant information. Materiality is based on the idea that not all sustainability issues are equally important and that companies should focus their reporting efforts on the issues that are most material to their business and stakeholders.There are different types of materiality, including single materiality, impact materiality, and double materiality, each with their own benefits and limitations. In this article, we will explore the concept of materiality in sustainability reporting, and discuss the different types of materiality and how they are used in different reporting standards.Single materiality is a type of materiality that considers the impact of sustainability issues on a company's financial performance. Sustainability issues are considered material only if they could have a significant financial impact on the company. Single materiality is often used in traditional financial reporting frameworks and is still commonly used in sustainability reporting by some companies and reporting standards.Benefits: single materiality provides a clear and straightforward way to determine which sustainability issues to report on, and it helps companies prioritise their reporting efforts on the issues that are most important for their financial performance.Limitations: single materiality may overlook sustainability issues that are important to stakeholders but do not have a direct financial impact on the company.Impact materiality is a type of materiality that considers the impact of sustainability issues on a company's stakeholders and the broader society. It recognises that sustainability issues can have significant social and environmental impacts that are not always reflected in a company's financial statements. Benefits: impact materiality provides a more holistic view of sustainability performance, and it helps companies identify and prioritise sustainability issues that are important to their stakeholders and society.Limitations: impact materiality can be difficult to measure the impact of sustainability issues accurately, and it may be subjective and open to interpretation. Double materiality is a type of materiality that considers the impact of sustainability issues on a company's financial performance, as well as the impact of the company's activities on the broader economy and society. It recognises that a company's sustainability performance can affect not only its own financial performance but also the broader economic and social systems in which it operates. Benefits: double materiality provides a more comprehensive and transparent view of sustainability performance, and it helps companies and stakeholders understand the broader implications of sustainability issues beyond the company's immediate financial performance.Limitations: double materiality can be more complex to apply than single or impact materiality, and it may require more extensive data collection and analysis. The current sustainability reporting standards landscape is witnessing two significant developments that can affect a company’s materiality assessment.The first development is the creation of the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) based on double materiality for a multi-stakeholder audience, including investors, led by GRI and the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG).The second development is the standards for the disclosure being drafted by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) under the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation. The IFRS Foundation’s focus is on meeting the information needs of investors. Therefore, the ISSB uses the same definition of ‘material’ that is used in IFRS Accounting Standards – that is, information is material if omitting, obscuring or misstating it could be reasonably expected to influence investor decisions. The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) is a new EU regulation that aims to improve the way companies report sustainability information. It updates and strengthens the rules introduced by the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) adopted in 2014. The CSRD incorporates the concept of double materiality, requiring companies to report on how sustainability issues might create financial risks for the company, as well as the company's impacts on people and the environment.The CSRD mandates the adoption of the ESRS, which provide clarity to companies about what they have to disclose and establish a reporting framework allowing companies to report in a systematic, credible, and comparable manner about their sustainability performance. While the EU supports the objectives of the ISSB standards to set a global baseline for sustainability reporting, the EU's standards should integrate the content of ISSB standards to the extent that it is consistent with the EU's legal framework and the ambitions of the European Green Deal.",unstructured
58,03/05/2023,96,59,"Greenstone's North American team had the opportunity to attend\xa0GreenBiz 23\xa0in Arizona, USA, in February. This three-day event had an action-packed agenda of keynote sessions, breakouts, workshops, roundtables and networking events that brought over 1,600 sustainability professionals together to harness each other’s knowledge and address the complex issues they face day-to-day. The Greenstone team attended several panel discussions that revolved around topics such as supply chain resilience, net zero, sustainability leadership, finance and ESG, and more. In this article, the Greenstone team shares five key topics that were discussed at the event.During one of the keynote sessions, Dr. Sally Uren, Chief Executive at\xa0Forum for the Future, spoke on the need for deep transformation in the world’s systems to ensure sustainability change can occur at the necessary speed and scale. As part of this transformation, Dr. Uren challenged sustainability professionals to shift their mindsets and focus on a new ambition for sustainability.Outlined below is the journey sustainability has taken over the years along with where it is challenged to go in order to produce just and regenerative outcomes. Version 1.0: minimising negative impacts and doing less harm.Version 2.0: becoming neutral and heading to zero whilst making sure you're not doing any harm.Version 3.0: where we've been for the past few years in sustainability, which is focusing on net positive to give back into the environment more than we take out. Version 4.0: the next generation of sustainability, which is deliberate in reconfiguring the systems we depend upon to enable them to thrive in the long term. This is the new ambition that is not just focused on doing less harm, but on creating socially just, regenerative systems that thrive. Another topic often discussed was the difference between ESG and sustainability. Traditionally, these terms are often used interchangeably, but there are important distinctions between the two.The following definitions come from an\xa0MIT article\xa0that was shared during the conference. ESG: “... is focused on screening companies for investments, largely by understanding how a business is affected by environment and social issues (with an additional focus on whether a company has good governance in place to manage those risks and pressures).”Sustainability: “… is a much broader idea, focusing on a company’s role in society, how it creates value by managing its environmental and social impacts (both positive and negative), and how its actions affect a long range of stakeholders.”With the distinct definitions of ESG and sustainability in mind, attendees were challenged to think about what is lost when they focus on ESG and not on broader sustainability. With ESG being mainly focused on disclosures for investment, organizations can run the risk of losing sight of the need for actual impact.Some considerations to make when balancing disclosure and impacts have been outlined in more detail below.Investors increasingly rely on ESG raters and rankers when making decisions, but the question was posed if we have gone too far with them. While these raters and rankers can be advantageous tools, there are also disadvantages and considerations to be made:Advantages: Sophistication - ESG raters and rankers typically use sophisticated methods to assess companies' sustainability performance, drawing on a wide range of data sources and research that can provide meaningful insights into risk and opportunities.Leadership buy-in/push - Companies may find that ESG raters and rankers can help build executive support for sustainability goals and initiatives in efforts to improve ratings and stakeholder perceptions. Disadvantages: ‘Check the box’ exercise (reporting for reporting’s sake) -ESG disclosure has the risk of becoming a box-ticking exercise, rather than a meaningful effort to drive progress on sustainability.Resource allocation - Responding to ESG raters and rankers can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive process for companies, particularly for smaller organisations or those with limited sustainability teams. With resources spent on disclosure, there can be little left over for implementing processes that drive sustainability.Scores that doesn’t reflect actual progress - ESG scores may not always accurately reflect a company's actual sustainability performance, and there is a risk that companies may selectively disclose information to improve their scores. Materiality assessments help bridge the gap between disclosure and impact in that they help inform organizations on which topics have impact and also what is important to the company’s stakeholders and investors. When looking through a\xa0double materiality\xa0lens, financial importance can be identified as well. One potential drawback of relying too heavily on ESG raters and rankers is that it can sometimes detract from the importance of storytelling in sustainability reporting. While sustainability reporting is often focused on disclosing quantitative data and metrics, it is also important to tell the story of a company's sustainability journey, and to highlight the positive impact that it has on its stakeholders and the broader community. One key consideration in sustainability reporting is the tension between striving for perfection and focusing on progress. While it is important to ensure that data is accurate and complete, it is also important to remember that sustainability is a journey, and progress towards goals is ultimately what matters most.During the event, there was a discussion about the future of mandatory sustainability disclosures, including the\xa0proposed rule by SEC. Currently, the\xa0proposed rule\xa0would require disclosure of climate-related risks, impacts, and governance processes as well as Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions. Scope 3 emissions are proposed to be required if deemed material or if the company has set a GHG emissions reduction target that includes Scope 3.Additional insights from the discussion are shared below.Investors look at risk and reward – climate is a huge riskExtreme weather events and regulatory changes can impact the financial performance of companies. This is why investors want more information from companies to better evaluate these factors. Mandatory disclosure can provide investors with the necessary information in a standardized format to make informed investment decisions and address challenges related to climate change.Investments committed to Net ZeroOver\xa0$66 trillion in assets\xa0are already covered by a net zero plan, indicating that many investors are working towards reducing their carbon footprint. Companies can disclose climate-related information to help investors evaluate their progress towards achieving net zero targets. This information can include emissions data and information on climate-related risks and opportunities.Need for comparable data in a comparable placeInvestors are calling for standardised disclosure that provides comparable data in a single location. Currently, investors are requesting different types of disclosures such as SASB, SBTi and TCFD, which can create confusion and make it difficult to compare data between companies. A standardised approach would make it easier for investors to evaluate companies and for companies themselves to provide the necessary information.Raters/rankers create a selective disclosure problemAs mentioned previously, rating agencies and ranking systems can create a selective disclosure problem and reporting overload, particularly when companies are asked to report to multiple frameworks. The proposed mandatory disclosure rule by SEC has the potential to decrease the number of frameworks that companies need to report to. Instead, companies can direct investors and stakeholders to their SEC filings for the necessary information.Align reporting to the GHG Protocol and TCFDTo prepare for the upcoming mandatory disclosure, companies should consider aligning their reporting with the Task Force for Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD)’s framework and with the\xa0Greenhouse Gas Protocol’s\xa0emissions accounting methodology as a proposed rule was modelled off them.Examine climate risks and opportunities Companies should also take a closer look at their climate risks and opportunities and build processes to address them. This includes setting up processes to measure and report on emissions, identifying areas of improvement, and implementing solutions to reduce the company's carbon footprint. Scope 3 emissions emerged as a key topic\xa0of concern during moderated sessions and networking events. We find it encouraging that sustainability professionals are all facing the challenges of Scope 3 emissions calculation and disclosure together. The reality is that no company has perfected it yet, and this is a complex issue that will require ongoing collaboration and effort to address.While the GHG Protocol breaks Scope 3 down into 15 categories, the most common challenges around Scope 3 with GreenBiz attendees stemmed from purchased goods and services, including supply chain engagement, and emissions associated with sold products. The following sections share additional details on these topics of concern.Provide tools to help suppliers/share best practicesIt is key to establish a partnership with suppliers and provide them with the necessary tools and knowledge to help them improve their sustainability practices. Sharing best practices can also be beneficial for suppliers to learn from one another and enhance their sustainability efforts.Make it clear why you are asking for certain information To enhance supplier engagement, it's crucial to provide clarity on the purpose behind requesting specific information. Instead of simply sending out a questionnaire, companies should add some context to it, explaining why they need the information and how it will help them achieve their net-zero targets or improve their performance metrics. Include sustainability as a performance metric By including sustainability as a performance metric, suppliers are more likely to comply with disclosing information. This can be achieved by incorporating sustainability goals and disclosure requirements into their contract language. When suppliers are held accountable for meeting these goals and disclosing information, it can increase their motivation to comply with your company's sustainability reporting requirements. Screen to identify hot spotsSpeakers on the subject emphasised the importance of conducting a screening to identify ""hot spots"" when assessing suppliers. This allows companies to prioritise their efforts and avoid wasting time on areas that may not be material or suppliers that are less impactful.Collect primary data instead of using spend-based calculationIt was highlighted that spend-based calculations for Scope 3 emissions present challenges and limitations. While it may be a good starting point, companies should aim to focus on primary data as they progress further in their sustainability reporting journey. Without primary data, the emissions of the supplier will be viewed as standard for that category, and any innovations or emissions reductions progress they have made will not be captured.  Many manufacturing companies and those that sell products in the market are placing a significant focus on life cycle analysis (LCA) and sold-product emissions. However, it's worth noting that many and organisations are still figuring out the optimal approach. Open-source LCA sites were mentioned as helpful, but if your organisation has the resources, conducting an LCA on your own products is more beneficial. Similar to the spend-based approach for suppliers, having primary data for your products is crucial, and you can then fill in any gaps as needed.",unstructured
59,26/04/2023,100,42,"Sustainability reporting is becoming an increasingly crucial aspect for businesses and investors alike, as global awareness of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues continues to rise. The global reporting initiative (GRI) standards provide a framework for companies to report on their ESG performance and impacts, and are widely recognised as the most comprehensive and widely used sustainability reporting framework in the world. In this article, we will explore the key aspects of GRI reporting and how companies can effectively use the GRI standards to strengthen their ESG strategy. We will also provide guidance on how to use Greenstone's ESG software to streamline the GRI reporting process. The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards are one of the most widely used sustainability reporting frameworks in the world. They provide a common language and framework for organisations to report on their ESG performance. The GRI Standards are developed through a globally recognised and independent process, involving hundreds of stakeholders from around the world. The Standards cover a range of sustainability issues, including climate change, human rights, corruption, and labour practices. They are designed to be flexible so that organisations can use them to report on their specific sustainability impacts and strategies. The GRI Standards also provide guidance on how to ensure the quality and credibility of sustainability reports, including the use of external assurance. The use of GRI standards allows for greater transparency and comparability of sustainability reporting across various industries worldwide. Companies using GRI standards are able to better demonstrate their commitment to sustainability and to provide stakeholders with important information about their ESG performance. This can help to enhance the reputation and credibility of the company, as well as to identify potential risks and opportunities related to ESG issues. In addition, the use of GRI standards can help companies to align their sustainability reporting with industry best practices and to improve the quality and relevance of their sustainability reporting. Greenstone’s sustainability reporting software has been certified by GRI’s Certified Software and Tools Program which guarantees that software and digital tools are using GRI content accurately, enabling robust and transparent reporting and making sustainability reports better, more accessible and easier to produce.

Using Greenstone’s software, companies can: Define bespoke question sets from a range of reporting frameworks, including GRI, CDP, SDGs, UNGC and many leading financial exchange reporting schemes, based on the relevance and materiality to their organisation.Create custom questions to cover any additional company-specific KPIs and metrics which can be integrated into questionnaires alongside content from reporting frameworks.Collect data and supporting information across a diverse organisation.Consolidate data into internal and external reporting templates.Analyse quantitative data on dashboards to assess performance and track progress over time. The GRI has a number of different standards that organisations can use, including the Universal Standard, Sector Standard, and Topic Standard. The GRI Universal Standard is the most comprehensive of the GRI standards. It provides a general framework for sustainability reporting that can be used by any organisation, regardless of its industry or sector. The Universal Standard covers a broad range of sustainability topics, including ESG issues. The GRI Sector Standard is a more specialised version of the Universal Standard. It provides a framework for sustainability reporting that is tailored to a specific industry or sector. The Sector Standard includes a set of core indicators that are relevant to that particular industry or sector, as well as additional indicators that organisations can choose to report on if they wish. The GRI Topic Standard is the most focused of the GRI standards. It provides a framework for reporting on a specific sustainability topic, such as water, energy, or climate change. The Topic Standard includes a set of core indicators that organisations can use to report on that topic, as well as additional indicators that they can choose to report on if they wish. It is important for organisations to recognise the central role they play in driving economic growth and development. Businesses and organisations have the power to create jobs, generate wealth, and provide goods and services that improve people's lives. However, they also have the potential to cause environmental degradation and social inequality if they are not managed in a responsible and sustainable manner. Sustainable development for businesses involves balancing economic, social, and environmental considerations in order to create a more sustainable future. This can involve implementing sustainable business practices, such as reducing waste and emissions and engaging with stakeholders to ensure that the organisation's actions align with their needs and expectations. Businesses and organisations should look at sustainable development as a way of maximizing their positive contributions while minimizing their negative impacts. To prepare a high-quality environmental report, it is important to follow a systematic and comprehensive approach. This may involve conducting a thorough analysis of an organisation's environmental performance, including its impact on air, water, and soil quality, as well as its greenhouse gas emissions and waste generation. The report should also include an evaluation of the organisation's compliance with relevant environmental laws and regulations. In addition, the report should include information on the organisation's efforts to reduce its environmental impact and improve its sustainability performance. This might include details of any initiatives or projects the organisation has implemented to reduce its environmental footprint, as well as any targets or goals it has set for future sustainability improvements. A high-quality environmental report should provide a clear and concise overview of an organisation's environmental performance, highlighting both its strengths and areas for improvement. To effectively address sustainability issues, it is important to involve stakeholders in the process. By engaging with these stakeholders, organisations can gain valuable insights into their concerns and priorities and can use this information to inform their sustainability strategy and decision-making. Involving stakeholders can also help to build trust and improve communication, as well as provide opportunities for collaboration and co-creation of solutions to sustainability challenges. Involving stakeholders in sustainability efforts can help to ensure that the organisation's actions align with the needs and expectations of those who are impacted by its activities. To effectively address sustainability issues and enhance your ESG strategy, it is important to use a comprehensive and standardised framework for reporting on ESG performance. By using the GRI standards in conjunction with Greenstone's ESG software solutions, organisations can streamline their sustainability reporting processes and gain valuable insights into their ESG performance. The major steps of using GRI standards include determining the relevant modules to use, applying the reporting principles, assessing materiality, collecting ESG data, filling the GRI content index, and publishing disclosures and registering the GRI report. By following these steps, organizations can use the GRI standards and Greenstone's ESG software solutions to fortify their ESG strategy and improve their sustainability performance. To effectively use the GRI standards to strengthen your ESG strategy, it is important to determine the relevant modules to use. This will help to ensure that your sustainability reporting is comprehensive and covers all of the key ESG issues that are relevant to your organisation. One of the first steps in determining the relevant GRI standards is to set an ESG goal for your organisation. This could be a specific target or objective related to your organisation's ESG performance. Setting an ESG goal will help to focus your reporting efforts and provide a clear framework for assessing your organisation's performance. Once you have set an ESG goal, you should assess how much data you have available for reporting, and how much additional data you need to collect in order to prepare your sustainability report. This will help you to determine the scope and scale of your reporting efforts and to identify any gaps in your data that need to be addressed. You should also consider your organisation's resources and capabilities in terms of undertaking a sustainability report. Greenstone's ESG software solutions can help organisations to overcome these challenges and effectively use the GRI standards to strengthen their ESG strategy. Our software modules are designed to support a range of different ESG reporting needs. Our software includes modules such as Environment, Frameworks, Health &amp; Safety, that can help you to collect and manage your ESG data, prepare your sustainability report, and disclose your report publicly, in accordance with the GRI standards. By using Greenstone's software solutions, you can streamline your sustainability reporting processes and gain valuable insights into your ESG performance. The reporting principles that are outlined in the GRI standards are designed to guide organisations in their sustainability reporting efforts and provide a framework for ensuring the quality and transparency of their reports. The six reporting principles of the GRI standards for defining the report quality are: Comparability: This principle emphasises the importance of using consistent metrics and indicators to compare an organisation's performance on ESG issues over time and across different organisations.Accuracy: This principle emphasises the importance of ensuring that the data and information included in a sustainability report is accurate and complete.Timeliness: This principle emphasises the importance of reporting on ESG issues in a timely manner, in order to provide stakeholders with current and relevant information.Clarity: This principle emphasises the importance of presenting information in a clear and concise manner, using language and visualisations that are easy to understand.Reliability: This principle emphasises the importance of ensuring that the data and information included in a sustainability report is reliable and can be trusted.Conclusion: This principle emphasises the importance of providing a conclusion or summary that clearly communicates the key findings and implications of the sustainability report. By basing your data collection and reporting approach on these principles, you can ensure that your sustainability report is of high quality and provides valuable information to stakeholders. Greenstone's ESG software solution can help you to apply these principles in your reporting efforts. Our software provides a comprehensive and standardised solution for collecting, managing, and reporting on ESG data, and can help you to ensure that your sustainability report is transparent, accurate, and reliable. To assess materiality, you should consider the views and expectations of your stakeholders, as well as the potential impacts of your organisation's operations on the environment and society. For example, if your organization is a retail company, you might consider the impact of your operations on climate change, as well as the working conditions in your supply chain. By assessing materiality, you can ensure that the topics reported on in your sustainability report are relevant and applicable to your organization, and are based on the real and potential impact of your operations. Greenstone's ESG software solution can help you to assess materiality and identify the most relevant topics for your sustainability report. We are proud to provide bespoke and widely customisable software that enables users to upload a variety of KPIs and metrics to help them assess their sustainability performance. By using Greenstone's software, you can gain valuable insights into your organisation's ESG performance and identify the most material topics for your sustainability report. Collecting ESG data includes determining the specific disclosures that are required by the GRI standards that you have chosen to use. Once you have identified the relevant GRI indicators, indicators that your organisation is required to report on, you can collect the ESG data using a variety of methods, such as surveys, interviews, and on-site measurements. You should ensure that the data is collected in a consistent and accurate manner and that it is properly organised and stored for future reference. You should also consider the quality and reliability of the data, and take steps to verify and validate the information to ensure its accuracy and completeness. By collecting and disclosing ESG data based on the specific disclosures required by the GRI standards, you can create a high-quality sustainability report that provides valuable information to stakeholders. Greenstone's ESG software solution can help you to collect and manage your ESG data and to align your sustainability report in accordance with the GRI standards. Once you have collected and organised your ESG data, you can use the GRI standards to guide the preparation of your sustainability report. One of the key steps in this process is to fill the GRI content index, which is a standardised table that provides an overview of the disclosures included in your sustainability report. The content index is organised according to the GRI standards and includes information on the specific indicators and disclosures that are included in your report. Once you have prepared the content index, you can use it to guide the organisation and presentation of your sustainability report. The content index can help you to ensure that your report is structured and easy to navigate and that it provides a clear and concise overview of your organisation's ESG performance. Greenstone's ESG software solution can make this process simple and straightforward. By using Greenstone's software, you can quickly and easily prepare the content index for your sustainability report, and ensure that it meets the requirements specified in the GRI standards. Finally, after you prepare your sustainability report using the GRI standards, you can publish your report to release it to the public. In addition to publishing your sustainability report, you should also register your report with the GRI. This involves notifying GRI that you have used their standards to develop your sustainability report and providing them with the necessary information to verify your report. This can help to build trust and credibility with stakeholders and demonstrate your organisation's commitment to the GRI standards.",unstructured
60,19/04/2023,35,14,"Procurement is changing, which means the way organisations engage with their suppliers, manage their supplier relationships, and make their purchasing decisions is changing. There are multiple factors that contribute to this, such as more global supply chains, perceived efficiencies through digitisation, and the changing way in which services are delivered. However, the focus on managing supply chains more responsibly, or sustainably, is something that is relevant to all current and future procurement and supplier management activities. Sustainability is a key part of the evolution of procurement, and therefore needs to be fully understood and implemented. An estimated 70% of international trade today involves global value chains (GVCs), as services, raw materials, parts, and components cross borders – often numerous times. Once incorporated into final products they are shipped to consumers all over the world. This makes it crucial that organisations respond to an increased level of supply chain legislation, related stakeholder expectations and resultant supply chain risk. Companies are now operating in a world where company responsibility extends beyond the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) challenges of its own operations, and into far-reaching global supply chains. As a result, companies are increasingly seeking to create more sustainable supply chains. This is achieved by improving ESG performance throughout the supply chain, and in turn seeking to reduce costs, increase labour productivity, improve current processes, innovate and differentiate, as well as having a positive impact upon society. All these factors tend to fall under the remit of different departments within a business, which has led to the evolution of the ‘sustainable procurement’ professional.  This shift in the necessity for a ‘sustainable procurement’ function represents one of the greatest opportunities for business. But how does this change impact businesses? And are businesses currently structured in an appropriate way to take advantage of the opportunities available? A key challenge in aligning sustainability and procurement functions and practices is that until recently organisations have not necessarily been structured in such a way that facilitates alignment. The most obvious example of this is the difficulty with which organisations assign responsibility for tackling their supply chain. Even if creating more responsible supplier practices is something that is viewed as important by senior stakeholders, the roles at individual and department level do not necessarily reflect this. The most natural area of a business to address supply chain risk and compliance is often seen as procurement, as this is where the relationships with suppliers naturally exist. However, traditionally the success of a procurement function is determined by value and service delivery, meaning anything that diverges from this can be misunderstood or treated with scepticism. Conversely, the sustainability or legal and risk teams within an organisation are well placed from a knowledge perspective to assess suppliers on relevant metrics, gauge compliance and satisfy reporting requirements. They are not however best placed to leverage supplier relationships or apply their knowledge to the supplier selection processes. The increased scrutiny on supply chains represents operational, financial, regulatory and reputational risks to an organisation. Businesses tend to be risk driven, and when faced with such risks involve the relevant operational and knowledge bases within the company to address them. Addressing supply chain risk, and in turn creating more responsible supply chains, should be no different. An integrated approach is required to embed sustainability into the operations of the company. To achieve this the criteria upon which suppliers are assessed need to combine both sustainability and traditional metrics, such as price and quality. This more holistic approach should not just be applied to the supplier selection process, but also form an integral part of ongoing supplier assessment and performance review. How to successfully adopt a more integrated approach depends on the structure of the organisation. Creating a sustainable procurement function that sits between sustainability and procurement, providing a link between the subject matter experts, is just one way. The key however, is that the lines of communication are opened between the appropriate areas of the business to ensure good governance practices and positive environmental, social and economic impacts, throughout the entire procurement and supplier management process.",unstructured

62,05/04/2023,35,23,"Greenstone's North American team recently attended the\xa0North American Sustainability &amp; Responsibility Summit\xa0(NASRS) held outside of Austin, Texas. The summit served as a platform for sustainability, CSR, and EHS leaders from various industries and organisations to network and learn from each other. Keynotes, case studies, workshops, panel discussions, and networking opportunities over two and a half days allowed attendees to share ideas and innovative solutions to common challenges. During the event, a number of important themes emerged. In this article, the Greenstone team shares five key topics that were discussed at NASRS23. An important area of discussion was net-zero goals. Although net-zero goals are not a new trend, many corporations have now set specific science-based targets and are making significant progress towards achieving them. With the progress, many companies discussed reaching an inflexion point where they have reduced their carbon footprint as much reasonably possible. This inflexion point leads them to consider offsets and removals. Attendees were challenged to use offsets only when necessary and to focus on innovation until the last minute. During a keynote discussion on the topic, Microsoft communicated that they focus on carbon removal credits instead of offsets or avoidance. It was also discussed that due-diligence is key to ensure only high-quality removal credits are purchased. A common theme of the discussions that took place at NASRS23 was the concept of ‘greenhushing’. This term refers to companies taking steps to remain silent about their climate strategies by either avoiding the topic or refusing to comment on it. The reasons behind greenhushing can include avoiding backlash from those opposed to climate action, not wanting to be called out for falling short of their targets, or hiding any instances of greenwashing. Greenhushing is cause for concern as it hinders progress towards achieving sustainability goals and puts companies at odds with their stakeholders. It is important for companies to find a balance between disclosure and action. They must avoid reporting for solely the sake of reporting and engaging in greenwashing or greenhushing. Instead, companies should focus on taking action and making a meaningful impact in their sustainability efforts. By doing so, they can maintain transparency with their stakeholders and work towards achieving their goals. The circular economy and life cycle analysis (LCA) were discussed by many in attendance at the event, particularly when it comes to expanding scope 3 to include emissions from sold products. By expanding scope 3 reporting to include emissions from the products they design, manufacture, and sell, companies can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of their operations, identify opportunities to reduce emissions throughout the entire product life cycle, and provide clarity to consumers, investors, and other stakeholders who inquire about their products. LCAs are a critical component of calculating product emissions. A number of resources and standards exist to assist companies with their LCA and calculation of sold product emissions, including ISO’s overarching standard in which they outline the four phases of an LCA and the\xa0GHG Protocol’s Product Life Cycle and Accounting Reporting Standard. In line with efforts to reduce carbon emissions and decarbonise the global economy, electrification was mentioned considerably throughout the event. Many large companies are focusing on electrification, including GM, which aspires to\xa0eliminate tailpipe emissions\xa0from new U.S. light-duty vehicles by 2035. This is in line with the growing trend towards electric vehicles (EVs) as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transportation. In addition, Frito-Lay has also launched a\xa0large initiative\xa0to decarbonise one of the largest manufacturing facilities in the United States. Not only does the transition to renewable energy sources help companies can reduce their carbon footprint and improve their overall sustainability performance, but it also has positive impacts on local communities including decreased air pollution. The reduction of value chain emissions continues to be a hot topic amongst sustainability professionals. Organisations want to ensure their value chains are sustainable and many have found success through closely collaborating with their suppliers and value chain partners. By clearly communicating expectations and combining expertise, companies are able to work directly with their suppliers to innovate and tackle emissions together. For example,\xa0PepsiCo and Frito-Lay\xa0directly work with the farmers who source their products. Through this partnership, they are able to learn what works for their farmers and spread the adoption of regenerative farming.",unstructured
63,29/03/2023,102,49,"Earlier last week, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released ‘Synthesis’, the final instalment of its sixth assessment report, which is the most comprehensive review of climate science to date. The report highlights that human-caused climate change is already having severe impacts on vulnerable people and ecosystems worldwide, as the Earth is warming faster than previously thought. However, there is still time to take effective action to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change. Here are some of the key takeaways from the report. The report highlights the urgent need for deep, rapid, and sustained greenhouse gas emissions reduction as crucial to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. It is essential to take immediate and decisive action to reduce emissions across all sectors, including transportation, energy production, and agriculture. The findings of the report reinforce the need for global cooperation and decisive action to mitigate the most severe impacts of climate change and protect our planet's future. The window of opportunity to take meaningful action is rapidly closing, and it is crucial that we act now to create a more sustainable future for ourselves and for generations to come. The burning of fossil fuels, coupled with unsustainable energy and land use, has led to a global warming of 1.1°C above pre-industrial levels. This increase in temperature has resulted in more frequent and intense extreme weather events, leading to increasingly dangerous impacts on both nature and people in every region of the world. The consequences of climate change are far-reaching and include rising sea levels, more severe droughts, and devastating wildfires, among other things. The urgent need to transition away from high polluting energy and fuel cannot be overstated, as the continued use of unsustainable practices will only exacerbate these problems. We must view the transition to decarbonised forms of energy not only as a positive but an urgent necessity. Climate justice is a critical issue, as those who have contributed the least to climate change are being impacted the most. Additionally, nearly half of the world's population lives in regions that are highly vulnerable to climate change, which only exacerbates the issue. The key to solving this problem lies in climate-resilient development, which involves incorporating measures to adapt to climate change while simultaneously working to reduce or avoid greenhouse gas emissions in ways that provide broader benefits. Climate-resilient development is crucial as it helps communities to better prepare for and withstand the effects of climate change while simultaneously working towards a more sustainable future. Political commitment, coordinated policies, international cooperation, ecosystem stewardship, and inclusive governance are all crucial for achieving effective and equitable climate action. To combat climate change, it is essential to implement policies that promote sustainable development, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and preserve natural ecosystems. International cooperation is vital to ensure that all countries work together towards a common goal. Additionally, ecosystem stewardship, including the conservation of approximately 30-50% of the Earth's land, freshwater, and oceans, is crucial for ensuring a healthy planet. This requires inclusive governance that ensures the participation of all stakeholders, including local communities and indigenous peoples. By prioritising effective and equitable climate action, we can create a more sustainable and resilient future for all. Lastly, here's some uplifting news: a multitude of solutions to our current challenges are readily accessible today and have the potential to positively impact various aspects of our lives. Not only do they address health, equity, justice, biodiversity, and economic concerns, but they also enhance our resilience and expedite the shift towards a sustainable, clean energy future.

64,22/03/2023,54,36,"Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are a major contributor to climate change, thus reduction efforts are crucial in addressing global environmental challenges. It is important to have a standardised methodology for measuring and reporting such emissions, in order to track these efforts and mitigate the effects of emissions. The GHG Protocol is a widely recognised standardised framework for quantifying and reporting GHG emissions. It provides guidelines and tools for companies, governments, and other organisations to measure and report their GHG emissions in a consistent and transparent manner. In this article, we will take a closer look at the GHG Protocol, who uses it, and what the different standards and guidelines are. This article aims to help businesses looking to reduce emissions in understanding the role of the GHG Protocol in the measurement of GHG emissions. The GHG Protocol was created in 1998 in a unified effort between the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) to establish global standards for the measurement and management of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In 2001, the first Corporate Standard was published to provide requirements and guidance for companies and other organisations preparing a GHG emissions inventory. It was designed with the following objectives in mind: To help companies prepare a GHG inventory that represents a true and fair account of their emissions through the use of standardised approaches and principlesTo simplify and reduce the costs of compiling a GHG inventoryTo provide business with information that can be used to build an effective strategy to manage and reduce GHG emissionsTo increase consistency and transparency in GHG accounting and reporting among various companies and GHG programmes The GHG Protocol established the, now ubiquitous, definitions of the Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions categories. Scope 1 is defined as “direct emissions from business operations”.Scope 2 are indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity consumed in company-owned or controlled equipment, or operations.Scope 3 are classified as indirect upstream and downstream emissions and include any and all emissions that result as a consequence of activities of the company, but occur from sources not owned or controlled by the company. For an in-depth resource on Scope 3 reporting, the GHG Protocol published another standard in 2011, the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard. The classification of emissions into these clearly defined categories allows for consistency in reporting and allows for more valid comparisons. It is up to the discretion of the organisation, or the reporting agency, which Scopes are reported. The guidelines are used by companies, organisations, cities and governments. In 2016, 92% of Fortune 500 companies responded to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) reporting questionnaire, which requires adhering to the methodology prescribed by the GHG Protocol for emissions calculations. Here are some ways in which these organisations use the GHG Protocol: Companies:\xa0A company might use the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard to measure and report its GHG emissions from its operations, including energy use, transportation, and waste management. The company can then use the data to identify areas where it can reduce emissions, such as improving energy efficiency, using renewable energy sources, or reducing waste.Governments:\xa0A government might use the GHG Protocol Public Sector Standard to measure and report GHG emissions from its operations and public services, including energy use in buildings, transportation, and waste management. The government can use this data to identify areas of potential reductions, such as improving energy efficiency in buildings, promoting public transportation, and reducing waste.Non-profits:\xa0A non-profit organisation might use the GHG Protocol to measure and report GHG emissions from its operations, including energy use, transportation, and waste management. The non-profit will utilize the data to identify areas where it can reduce emissions, such as improving energy efficiency, using renewable energy sources, or reducing waste. Data analysis can inform target setting for emissions reductions and to track progress over time. The GHG Protocol and its series of standards outline the optimal methods of data collection and the process to convert activity data to GHG emissions. The scopes of emissions required for reporting vary for each Standard and are often reliant on data availability. The practice of successful reporting requires valid and consistent data. The GHG Protocol generated a myriad of standards encompassing GHG accounting methodologies for almost all entities, such as: The Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventories (GPC) provides a robust framework for accounting and reporting city-wide greenhouse gas emissions. Best for: Cities and Communities The GHG Protocol Mitigation Goal Standard provides guidance for designing national and subnational mitigation goals and a standardised approach for assessing and reporting progress toward goal achievement. Best for: Countries and Cities The Product Standard can be used to understand the full life cycle emissions of a product and focus efforts on the greatest GHG reduction opportunities. This is the first step towards more sustainable products. Best for: Companies and Organisations The GHG Protocol Policy and Action Standard provides a standardised approach for estimating the greenhouse gas effect of policies and actions. Best for: Countries and Cities The GHG Protocol for Project Accounting is the most comprehensive, policy-neutral accounting tool for quantifying the greenhouse gas benefits of climate change mitigation projects. Best for: Companies and Organisations; Countries and Cities The GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard provides a framework for companies and other organisations to measure and report their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The main objective is to help companies produce a GHG inventory that is a true and fair account of their emissions, and to do so in a consistent, transparent, and cost-effective manner. The standard was developed with the input of over 350 experts from the business, government, non-profit, and accounting sectors, and has been tested by over 30 companies across 9 countries. It covers all significant sources of GHG emissions, including direct emissions from owned or controlled operations, as well as indirect emissions from the purchase of electricity, heat, and steam. The Corporate Standard can be used by a wide range of organisations, including companies, NGOs, government agencies, and universities, who have operations that give rise to GHG emissions. However, it is not intended for use in quantifying emissions reductions for the purpose of offsetting or credits. Policymakers and GHG program designers can also use relevant parts of the standard to inform their own accounting and reporting requirements. The Corporate Standard is compatible with most existing GHG programs and their own accounting and reporting requirements. It is a neutral standard that focuses solely on the accounting and reporting of emissions, but does not require organisations to report their emissions to the WRI or WBCSD. Additionally, the standard provides guidance on developing a verifiable inventory, but does not dictate the specific verification process that must be followed. The Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard provides a methodology for companies to account for and report their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from activities outside of their own operations. The development of the standard involved a multi-stakeholder process that lasted over three years, with 2,300 participants from 55 countries and 34 companies testing the standard. The standard is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, with accompanying guidance and tools provided by the GHG Protocol to help organisations with implementation. Until recently, most companies primarily focused on measuring emissions from their own operations and electricity consumption. However, it is common fora majority of a company's total emissions to be attributed to its value chain, or Scope 3 emissions, and the Scope 3 Standard is the only internationally accepted method for companies to account for these emissions. Users of this standard can now calculate emissions from 15 categories of Scope 3 activities, both upstream and downstream of their operations. The framework supports companies in partnering with suppliers and customers to address climate impacts throughout the value chain. By implementing the Scope 3 Standard, companies can gain a more comprehensive understanding of their GHG emissions and take meaningful action to reduce them. The GHG Protocol is implemented by organisations through the use of its standards and guidelines for measuring and reporting GHG emissions. The process of implementation typically involves the following steps: Choose organisational boundarySet operational boundaryClassify emissionsEstablish how to collect data inventoryEstablish how to calculate emissionsSet up quality management for data/inventory Organisations play a critical role in implementing the GHG Protocol by using its standards and guidelines to measure their GHG emissions. By doing so, organisations can identify the sources of their emissions and act to reduce emissions in a transparent way. The reporting of emissions using the GHG Protocol helps organisations to track their progress over time, set emissions reduction targets, and measure the impact of their efforts to reduce emissions. Finally, in addition to the benefits for individual organisations, the GHG Protocol also provides benefits to the global community. The standardisation of GHG emissions reporting increases the comparability of emissions data across different organisations and sectors, which in turn informs policy decisions and drives collective action to reduce emissions. The GHG Protocol also provides a common framework for stakeholders to understand and communicate about GHG emissions, which helps to increase public awareness and support for action to mitigate climate change.",unstructured
65,15/03/2023,24,16,"The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) met in Montreal recently and announced its final decision on the technical content of its initial two IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards. The ISSB’s Standards will now go through a thorough drafting and formal ‘balloting’ approval process, ahead of their issuance towards the end of Q2 2023. Established at COP26 in late 2021, the ISSB has developed a comprehensive global baseline of sustainability disclosures for the capital markets; one sets out general sustainability-related disclosure requirements and the other specifies climate-related disclosure requirements. The ISSB’s initial two standards focus on general sustainability disclosure requirements (IFRS S1) and climate (IFRS S2). Proposals of these standards were released in March 2022, after which the ISSB received 1,400+ comment letters, that the ISSB considered in its 2022 and 2023 board meetings. S1 asks for disclosure of material information about a company’s sustainability-related risks and opportunities. It uses the same definition of material that is used in IFRS Accounting Standards – that is, companies must determine that information is material i.e. that which if absent, obscured, or misstated could be reasonably expected to influence investor decisions. S1 emphasises the need for consistency and connections between financial statements and sustainability disclosures, requiring financial statements and sustainability disclosures to be published at the same time. (The ISSB has introduced a transitional relief to allow later reporting of the sustainability information aligned with the first half results for a short period of time.) S2 sets out disclosure of material information about climate-related risks and opportunities, including disclosure about physical risks (such as flood risk), transition risk (such as regulatory change) and climate-related opportunities (such as new technologies). As part of its work to support adoption and high-quality disclosures, the ISSB has developed a package of reliefs and guidance to support initial use of the Standards, enabling companies at all stages of sustainability disclosure to scale up their approach to using them over time. As part of its work to consolidate a fragmented disclosure landscape and provide a clear pathway for current sustainability reporters, the ISSB is building off existing and widely used standards and frameworks. Here’s how these are being used in the ISSB’s work: The SASB Standards are used by over 2,500 companies worldwide. They are made up of 77 industry-based disclosure standards developed to provide decision-useful information to investors. Using the SASB Standards now will help in the future application of IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards.As described in S1, industry-specific disclosures are required by those applying the ISSB’s Standards, and companies need to consider the existing SASB Standards to identify topics and metrics to disclose in the absence of a specific ISSB Standard.This means the SASB Standards will continue to be supported on a standalone basis by the ISSB for at least four years, and realistically probably longer, while the ISSB continues its standard-setting activities using the SASB Standards as a basis.The ISSB has introduced rigorous due diligence process to ensure the SASB Standards are maintained and enhanced over this time with any proposed changes being subject to public consultation.The climate-related aspects of the SASB Standards are now illustrative guidance that a company needs to consider, but is not required to use when using S2.More information on the future of the SASB Standards. The TCFD Recommendations have over 4,000 supporters worldwide and were designed to solicit decision-useful, forward-looking information that can be included in mainstream financial filings. The core structure of the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards is adopted from the TCFD architecture to solicit information on governance, strategy, risk management and metrics and targets. S1 and S2 fully incorporate the TCFD Recommendations, and so those disclosing against S1 and S2 will meet the TCFD Recommendations. The CDSB Framework has been incorporated into S1 and S2, and CDSB application guidance on biodiversity-related and water-related disclosures are sources of guidance a company can consider in its disclosures to investors in the absence of a specific ISSB Standard. The Integrated Reporting Framework is a principles-based, multi-capital framework used by over 2,500 companies in more than 75 countries to communicate how a company creates, preserves and erodes value over time for itself and its investors. The Integrated Reporting Framework’s concepts are reflected in S1 to describe the relationship between sustainability and financial value creation.Continued use of the Integrated Reporting Framework is encouraged to support high-quality corporate reporting and to drive connectivity between financial statements and sustainability-related financial disclosures.",unstructured
66,08/03/2023,27,11,"SBTi recently released “Catalysing Value Chain Decarbonisation”, a comprehensive, global and cross-sector survey to better understand the barriers and limitations companies face when baselining, setting and delivering scope 3 science-based targets. Below is a summary of the surveyThe report and survey highlight the crucial role of value chain decarbonisation in the transition towards a net-zero economy. It reveals that value chain emissions, also known as scope 3 emissions, make up more than 70% of corporate greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories and are a part of 96% of validated science-based targets. Given the scale and importance of scope 3 target-setting, the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) has launched a process to review and update guidance, methods, and criteria to ensure effective value chain decarbonisation. To this end, a stakeholder engagement survey was conducted to understand the challenges faced by organisations when baselining, setting, and delivering scope 3 targets. The survey found that most organisations include scope 3 emissions in their GHG inventory, with a majority driven by a desire to set a science-based target. While regulatory disclosure was not a motivator, 60% of respondents believe that compliance scope 3 reporting will be required in the future. However, data access is a significant barrier to developing a robust baseline, with limited supplier data being a primary issue. In addition, companies face challenges such as limited time and resources, interpretation of GHG accounting standards, and low comparability of baselines between peers. 70% of organisations have re-baselined their emissions in the last five years, 50% of which have been due to methodological changes. Despite the inclusion of scope 3 commitments in 96% of validated science-based targets, 90% of respondents believe that the process for setting a scope 3 science-based target is challenging. Companies experience difficulties with low confidence in their ability to deliver scope 3 decarbonisation due to perceived consequences of failure and the maturity of delivery roadmaps. Additionally, a lack of target-setting methods tailored to company circumstances is a barrier, including sector specificity and accounting for growth. Respondents also cited unclear or ambiguous SBTi requirements, weak or unknown business cases, and a lack of understanding amongst company decision-makers as challenges for target setting. When it comes to delivering scope 3 decarbonisation, 50% of respondents report being off track for delivering their scope 3 target, despite executives being directly accountable for decarbonisation. Respondents identified emissions in scope 3 cat. 1, purchased goods and services, and scope 3, cat. 11, use of sold products as the most challenging to decarbonise. The top three challenges for target delivery include the ability to influence upstream suppliers, cost of decarbonisation, and the ability to track progress towards a target due to insufficient access to primary data. Company growth, ability to influence end-users, availability of decarbonisation technologies, and understanding which levers to use for demonstrating progress towards a science-based target were also considered barriers to target delivery.  The report concludes that tackling the challenges identified in the survey will require action from stakeholders across the climate ecosystem. Six high-level solutions have been identifiedimproving data collection and supply chain traceabilityenhancing accounting frameworkstarget-setting guidance and methodscollective value chain actioncontinued engagement of financiers and regulatorsincreased internal efforts.

67,01/03/2023,32,16,"Greenstone has been working with global manufacturer Hypertherm to improve the company’s data management across its global locations and supply chain. Through the use of Greenstone’s sustainability reporting software and sustainable supply chain software solutions, Hypertherm has been able to streamline data collection and access the accurate data required to set ambitious goals for 2030. Read the project case study below. Hypertherm is a 100% associate-owned industrial manufacturer headquartered in the US. From 16 sites across 10 countries, Hypertherm designs and manufactures plasma, waterjet and laser cutting systems and software for use in a variety of industries such as shipbuilding, manufacturing and automotive repair. Hypertherm uses Greenstone’s sustainability reporting software, Enterprise, and sustainable supply chain software, SupplierPortal, to collect, manage, analyse and report data across its offices, facilities and supplier network. As a manufacturing company, Hypertherm is challenged with managing large volumes of data, such as waste data and hardware-level energy data, from different areas of the business. Hypertherm has an environmental stewardship team of three people. This team’s focus is on how Hypertherm’s sustainability performance and emissions reduction can be improved across all three GHG scopes; from internally within its own production processes, all the way downstream to its suppliers and customers. The team relies on ‘Green Champions’ from all departments of the company to leverage their expertise within different subject areas. In order to engage with this group, and make sustainability relevant to all sides of the business, the team have consistently found themselves reaching for data to support this. However, the team found that using Excel as a database for tracking environmental data and emissions conversions were slowing down the process and had led to the reliance on a very large and unstable data set. This added a level of complication when needing to access and explain the data to colleagues, particularly when personnel changes took place. As a manufacturer, part of Hypertherm’s sustainability journey is to increase engagement with suppliers on a wide range of key sustainability and compliance metrics, including raw materials. As more focus was placed on these supplier relationships and the need for varied supplier information increased, it also became clear that existing methods of sustainable supplier management were not able to support Hypertherm’s long-term goals. Greenstone worked with Hypertherm to migrate all of its historical environmental data into Greenstone’s sustainability reporting software\xa0and fully implement the software across the organization. All ‘Green Champions’ were trained on how to view their environmental data within the software solution. To increase engagement, Greenstone’s user group permissions function was implemented to ensure that these users had access to certain views only containing the data which was meaningful to them. Additionally, Hypertherm implemented Greenstone’s sustainable supply chain\xa0software, working with Greenstone to review historical data sets and to create a new supplier assessment benchmark. The aim is to align Hypertherm’s purchasing and ongoing supplier management practices with their corporate goals across the environment, health and safety, anti-bribery and corruption, labour\xa0practices, product compliance and information security. By implementing Greenstone’s sustainability reporting software and sustainable supply chain software solutions across its 16 sites and its direct supply chain, Hypertherm’s team was able to streamline data collection across its organization and confidently and efficiently access the accurate data required to set ambitious goals for 2030. As a result of implementing Greenstone’s sustainability reporting software and sustainable supply chain software solutions, Hypertherm staff found they were able to access and understand data quicker than ever before. Greenstone’s sustainability reporting software, Enterprise, has enabled them to manage their environmental data across all sites and in turn focus on in-depth reporting and data analysis in order to set goals. The team can now easily demonstrate where improvements have been made, against tangible KPI’s, which has been instrumental in increasing the level of engagement across the company. Through Greenstone’s sustainable supply chain software, SupplierPortal, Hypertherm has been able to achieve greater transparency across its supplier network. Utilising the analysis tools available to Hypertherm can automatically identify risks, and engage suppliers in direct dialogue to remediate these through corrective actions. The flexibility of SupplierPortal, Greenstone's sustainable supply chain software, has also enabled Hypertherm to expand the program to additional suppliers and across further compliance areas, such as conflict minerals. Additionally, Greenstone’s sustainability software solutions have enabled Hypertherm to focus on more than just reporting and helped with the setting of their 2030 goals, spanning across their internal operations and their Scope 3 suppliers and customers. Greenstone’s sustainability software has given Hypertherm the ability to present the data in a way that explains the new targets to all parts of the business and ensures that everyone understands the part that they play in achieving these.",unstructured

The demand for greater transparency, accurate and reliable information and continuous monitoring against targets is growing. With reporting requirements constantly increasing, a huge volume of data needs to be collected, managed and reported across an organisation. One way to improve sustainability and ESG data management is to implement sustainability and ESG reporting software to automate and streamline the process. However, finding the right software solution for your business isn’t always straightforward.\xa0With the ever-evolving sustainability and ESG reporting landscape, you need to be sure that the software you choose is going to fulfil your non-financial, sustainability, supply chain and ESG reporting requirements both today and in the future.Whether you are moving beyond spreadsheets for the first time or looking to replace an existing system that isn’t working for your business, knowing where to start your search and what to look for can be a bit overwhelming.Below are 5 things to look for in sustainability and ESG reporting software.Having a sustainability and ESG reporting software solution that is intuitive and easy to use, particularly for first-time users, is very important. If a system is intuitive and easy to navigate, you’ll get people using it quickly and ultimately engaging with your sustainability initiatives. Unlimited restrictions on user profiles will ensure each person’s access gives them exactly what they need.Another thing to consider is whether the sustainability reporting software solution integrates with other systems. If the data managed in your ESG software can automatically feed into other systems or vice versa, this not only increases ease of use but also streamlines data management across your organisation.Sustainability reporting isn’t just the responsibility of the sustainability department anymore; it’s on the agenda and requires the collaboration of many different stakeholders. In particular, investors are starting to demand information on sustainability, ESG and exposure to climate risk.When selecting sustainability reporting software, you’ll need to consider whether the analytic tools and reporting available will fit the reporting requirements of all of your stakeholders. It’s also important to consider whether it will give you the results from your data that will help you engage with different audiences and help you make better-informed business decisions.Understanding the implementation process, and the timelines involved, in your selected sustainability and ESG reporting software is important. Not only so you know what to expect and what you need to prepare, but to ensure your selected software provider has the appropriate training and roll-out plans in place. For example, the number of upfront training days to get your team up to speed on the software is something to consider. And, if you think the number of days is unreasonably high, maybe you should question the usability of the solution. If you are transitioning from another system, it’s also useful to find out how the transition is managed and how continuity risk is minimised. For example, will both systems run alongside each other to avoid any downtime?As ESG reporting requirements increase, so does the volume and scope of data that you need to manage. When selecting software, think about whether the solution will evolve with your reporting requirements and adapt to your changing organisational structure in years to come. Sustainability reporting software takes investment in time and resources to implement so you need to be sure that the solution has the capability and innovation to grow with you. The software should be robust and flexible enough for your reporting both now, and in 5 years’ time, to enable you to achieve your long-term goals.Once you have selected and implemented your ESG reporting software solution, it’s important that you have access to the ongoing support to help you get the most from it. All too often organisations implement software and then find they don’t get the customer support they need.And it shouldn’t be just about the software either. You should think about whether you are confident that you’ll get subject matter support and best practice advice to support your broader sustainability reporting strategy",unstructured
69,15/02/2023,40,18,"Partnership for Accounting Financials (PCAF) is a worldwide collaboration of financial institutions that work together to develop and implement a harmonised approach to assess and disclose financed emissions. ‘Financed emissions’ are the GHG emissions relating to loans, underwriting, investments, and other financial services and products. In this article, we explain what PCAF is, how it impacts financed emissions reporting and how financial institutions can participate. PCAF was created in 2015 by Dutch financial institutions (FIs) to unify the initiatives that global FIs utilise to disclose the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of their financial activities. This industry-led initiative spread to North America in 2018 and went global in 2019. In 2020, PCAF developed and published the ‘Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry’ comprising three ‘Parts’; one of which being the ‘Financed Emissions Standard’. As of the writing of this article, there are 347 FIs that are members of PCAF, with expected continued expansion as more institutions act to mitigate their contributions to climate change. There are PCAF regional implementation teams in North America, Latin America, Europe, Africa, and Asia-Pacific. This Standard outlines a specific methodology to assist FIs in calculating and disclosing emissions generated by their investments and loans. The methodology provides an expansion of guidance on Scope 3 category 15 emissions outlined by the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain Standard. In addition, guidance is now included in questions in CDP reporting as of 2020, after an alignment of CDP with TCFD. PCAF’s Financed Emissions Standard defines seven asset classes, with detailed information about how to calculate emissions for each, to assist any FIs at the start of, or throughout their GHG accounting journey. The asset classes construct the backbone of the methodology and provide a level of inherent flexibility, which is of the utmost importance in this industry due to recognised limitations in data availability and quality. The asset classes currently covered were determined by PCAF to be the most relevant and largest shares of portfolios globally. FIs can choose to begin with measurement or disclosure at a specific asset class level or for a sector within a certain asset class. PCAF is open to any FI and therefore it has developed GHG accounting methodologies that apply to any FI. PCAF outlines four specific business goals of the Financed Emissions Standard: creating transparency for stakeholdersmanaging climate-related transition risksdevelopment of climate-friendly financial productsalignment of financial flows with the Paris Agreement. Any FI who wants to achieve related climate goals should follow the guidelines published by PCAF. The methodology provides expansion of guidance on Scope 3 category 15 emissions outlined by the GHG Protocol and is part of the CDP disclosure process. Therefore, any FI wanting to improve their CDP scores or enhance their data reporting for CDP should follow the standards created by PCAF. In late 2021, CDP and PCAF announced a partnership with the aim to combine their resources and networks to promote the PCAF Standard and to increase TCFD-aligned financed emissions reporting amongst FIs globally. Through this collaboration, CDP and PCAF aim to increase the number of FIs reporting financed emissions in line with PCAF Standard, and through CDP’s Financial Services Climate Change Questionnaire, to fill a critical data gap in climate reporting. Companies that join PCAF must commit to disclosing the GHG emissions associated with their portfolio of loans and investments within a period of three years, using the jointly developed accounting methodologies. The emission scopes required for reporting differs for each asset class, with Scope 1 emissions as mandatory for all asset classes, but the inclusion of Scope 2 and 3 varying for each. The multistep process standardised by PCAF is applied to each asset class. The asset classes covered are: Listed equity and corporate bonds, including all on-balance sheet and those traded on a market.Business loans and unlisted equity, including all on-balance sheet and those not traded on a market and that are privately held.Project finance, including all on-balance sheet loans or equities to projects for specific purposes, for instance, wind or solar projects.Commercial real estate, including all on-balance sheet loans for the purchase and refinance of real estate for commercial uses.Mortgages, on-balance sheet loans for the purchase and refinance of residential property.Motor vehicle loans, on-balance sheet loans and lines of credit to businesses and consumers to finance one or several motor vehicles.Sovereign debt, including all bonds and loans (of all maturities) issued in domestic or foreign currencies. Once a FI has decided to work with PCAF, they submit a commitment letter and participate in activities with the local regional implementation team. Within the first three years, it is expected that the committed FI calculates, assesses and discloses their financed emissions. This assessment process begins with an evaluation of the composition of the company portfolio and which asset class(es) the institution decides to begin with. Conducting a hot spot analysis to screen and prioritise the parts of the portfolio that would be the focus for target setting such as asset classes and sectors. The data collection proceeds from that decision point and the overall guidance for each asset class provides the types of data required for calculation. For each asset class, there are three options for dataset types provided by the PCAF guidelines. The options are organised in an inherent data quality scale, with Option 1 as the highest data quality score and Option 3 with the lowest data quality.  Unsure of where to start with PCAF?

70,08/02/2023,33,17,"Software as a Service (SaaS) has transformed the way we work, share data, and communicate. It means that we need fewer programs installed on our computers, and can access our data and services from more devices. As technology evolves and organisations become more global and complex, SaaS gives people access to the data they need, wherever they are. Sustainability, supply chain and ESG data is becoming more and more important in the corporate world and, as reporting requirements continuously evolve, the importance of accurate, secure and accessible data is crucial. Greenstone has been providing SaaS solutions for 15 years. Our solutions are built to evolve with our clients’ requirements for now and in the future.\xa0In this blog, we aim to uncover what SaaS is, and the advantages it has over other software delivery options.  Software as a Service is a method of software delivery that enables data to be available from any device with a web browser, rather than installed locally to run on PCs or networks. SaaS is typically licensed through an annual subscription model, and is owned, maintained and delivered by the software provider, rather than hosted on a client’s premises. This means software providers host and maintain the servers, databases and code that sit behind the software. For the buyer, this means the cost can be spread over time with no maintenance or IT involvement, making adoption and ongoing use easy and straightforward. Updates: With the software housed on a cloud-based server, it can be upgraded centrally, rather than the traditional model where the software would need to be upgraded on each machine. This means SaaS can be maintained with the latest version of the software at all times. Hardware: With the software run on a server, individual PCs do not need to be upgraded for hardware requirements, and there are no issues with not meeting minimum specs. Cost: With a subscription model, the cost of software can be spread over time and, as it is hosted in the cloud, the upfront implementation costs are significantly lower than with more traditional methods. Quick deployment: As the software does not need to be installed and configured on individual machines, SaaS can be much more rapidly deployed. Accessibility: Gaining access to SaaS just requires a browser and an internet connection, allowing users to be able to log in from anywhere. As well as this, the user’s data is stored in the cloud, and not tied to an individual user’s PC, facilitating collaboration with other users. Data security: All credible SaaS providers invest a huge amount in security, backups and maintenance. For this reason, a web-based system typically has more security measures in place than an on-premises system. SaaS providers regularly undergo stringent security procedure audits that test the data centre’s level of security. The chances are an individual IT department within may not hold themselves to the same standards. In the sustainability, supply chain and ESG software sectors, there are few enterprise SaaS solutions that can scale as the requirements of reporting organisations evolve.  Greenstone’s SaaS software solutions are built to evolve with its clients’ requirements for now and in the future. We understand that an organisation’s data management and reporting requirements may be very different in even a years’ time and we build our software with this in mind. Fujitsu is a leading provider of IT-based business solutions for the global marketplace. With approximately 130,000 employees supporting customers in 180 countries, Fujitsu is one of the world’s largest IT service companies. Since 2008, Fujitsu has used Greenstone’s software solutions and supporting services to collect, manage, monitor and reporting environment and ESG data across its global business. The data captured from the 400 Fujitsu sites is used to report emissions centrally to the Fujitsu Headquarters in Japan. This data forms the basis of the emissions reporting included in Fujitsu Group’s annual Environmental report and other reporting such as CDP, Business in the Community, GRI and ISO 26000. Fujitsu has been included on the prestigious CDP ‘A List’ since 2017.",unstructured
71,01/02/2023,62,31,"In mid-December, CDP released the 2022 scores for its Climate Change, Forests and Water Security disclosures. CDP is a leading carbon disclosure framework encouraging companies to disclose information regarding a multitude of factors across the sustainability sphere including emissions reduction and targets, risks and opportunities, and supply chain sustainability. In 2022, nearly 15,000 companies, with a collective worth of over US$11 trillion, submitted a response to CDP. It is clear that in 2022 there was a growing demand for environmental disclosure; investors with over $130 trillion in assets requested thousands of companies to respond. Companies disclosing in 2022 have a combined worth of over half of global market capitalisation, illustrating the prominence and importance of carbon disclosure in the present day. With rapidly increasing legislation and awareness of climate change and carbon management, this number will only continue to rise. Three hundred and thirty of the responding companies received a prestigious A grade. Greenstone is proud that some of its clients have been included on the “A List”; Fujitsu and Sopra Steria have been a part of this esteemed list since 2017 and 2016 respectively. A large number have also secured a B grade showing they are well on their way to becoming truly sustainable. CDP is a huge undertaking, Greenstone would like to congratulate all of its clients who successfully submitted to CDP in 2022. The CDP A List showcases the companies leading the way in all aspects of environmental transparency; they are at the top of the game in carbon disclosure, awareness, management and leadership. The number of companies being awarded an A grade has increased year on year by 35% from 2020 to 2021 and 34% from 2021 to 2022; progress is being made. 283 companies made the 2022 Climate Change A List25 companies made the 2022 Forests A List103 companies made the 2022 Water Security A List76% of companies on the Climate Change A List have an approved science-based emissions target (compared to 19% of A- to B- scoring companies, and 2% of C to D- scoring companies) and 95% of A List companies have a climate transition plan aligning to a 1.5oC world. Only 2% of companies that submitted made the A List. Almost 30,000 companies did not submit a CDP response even though they were requested to; which equates to a net worth of US$24.5 trillion. 66% of companies scoring D to A- have remained at the same grade since 2022, this stagnation will not lead to a climate transition in line with that of COP27. Finally, 59% of companies scored between D- and C meaning their journey to corporate sustainability is only just beginning. Urgent progress needs to be made towards a net zero world in order to keep global temperature increase below the crucial 2oC. Greenstone is a Gold Accredited CDP software partner. Greenstone’s global sustainability management software has been designed to meet the requirements of CDP reporting and has a suite of dedicated tools to streamline the process.

72,25/01/2023,56,23,"CDP recently published the following interview article on its website. In this interview, we speak to Jessica Thurston, VP of ESG Strategy at Paramount Global about the strong influence of the media and entertainment industry and the significance of Paramount’s evolving ESG strategy. Jessica also gives some helpful advice to companies thinking of reporting for the first time to CDP and explains how Greenstone's partnership has strengthened Paramount's ESG reporting through reliable and consistent data. Read the full article below In recent years, the world has been challenged by a global pandemic, the need for social and racial justice, and the intensifying effects of climate change. During this time, the media and entertainment industry has been recognized as one of the most powerful forces influencing culture, social views, and societal outcomes. In this interview, Jessica Thurston, Vice President, ESG Strategy at Paramount Global, one of the world's leading producers of premium entertainment content, speaks to ESG software solutions provider Greenstone about the strong influence of the media and entertainment industry and the significance of Paramount’s evolving ESG strategy.I am responsible for leading Paramount’s global Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) strategy. Paramount Global is a complex business, made up of well-known global brands – including CBS, MTV, Nickelodeon, Showtime, ViaCom, Miramax and Channel 5 – with a diverse audience. Although I am based in the US, my team’s role is inherently global. I joined the company in 2019 (when we were Viacom and then ViacomCBS) and ESG was something we knew was important as we re-merged Viacom and CBS – and we were quite early in our strategy journey. So, for the past three years, my team and I have been building out an ESG strategy that is grounded in reliable data and what is material to our business. My day-to-day role is really about finding opportunities for efficiency, clarity, further environmental responsibility and what resources we need to take them forward. Our ESG strategy is critical to our success as a company. We work to foster a better world for our employees, audiences, partners, and communities as Paramount. Paramount is popular, and it is our responsibility to measure and manage the ESG impacts we have as a global content powerhouse. At Paramount, we pride ourselves for being a workplace centred on diversity, inclusion and belonging, with equal opportunities for access and advancement. Paramount has a legacy of delivering content that explores and celebrates diversity and inclusivity. We are constantly building on this legacy with programming that centres diverse voices while taking on the issues relevant to those communities. On the environmental side, as a global media company, we are not a major emitter of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to some other industries. However, we cannot separate ourselves from the growing need for collective action. Our environmental strategy is focused on continuing to understand and mitigate environmental impacts across our company and value chain, and to use our content platforms to further raise awareness and inspire global action in response to the climate crisis. We are relatively early in our journey of telling our ESG story; and started by publishing our first company-wide ESG report in 2019–2020. This included a materiality assessment – a comprehensive analysis of the topic areas that are most relevant to Paramount, according to key internal and external stakeholders. In our second annual ESG report, we expanded upon our initial reporting and commitments, including the publishing of our in-development company-wide ESG goals across our three ESG priority areas: On-Screen Content and Social Impact, Workforce and Culture, and Sustainable Production and Operations. Our latest and third ESG report (2021–2022) highlights how we’ve progressed on our ESG strategy and goals across the three focus areas. We’ve also provided updates on our workforce and environmental impact data, and a more detailed overview of our ESG governance practices. We used external ESG reporting frameworks and guidance to influence the development of this report, including the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The effort to calculate carbon emissions across our global portfolio is a process we will continue to improve upon and manage. Over the last two years, through our partnership with Greenstone, we have advanced our reporting on carbon emissions in several areas. We are committed to improving our data coverage and accuracy across all three scopes, including data from productions. However, where actual data is not available we worked in collaboration with Greenstone to calculate estimates using established third-party benchmarks. This year we were also able to launch a commuter survey to capture commuter emissions data for the first time and will continue to run this survey alongside Paramount’s annual Green Week. Before coming to Paramount, I consulted for companies at every stage of the ESG and sustainability journey. Many companies just starting out in reporting often believe they need to have perfect answers before they can make a CDP submission. But really, CDP reporting is a tool – and it’s important to start wherever you are and establish a baseline for disclosure and evaluation. Many companies are still developing their climate change strategies and reporting to CDP is an important catalyst to help drive a company’s ongoing journey forward. Focusing on the topics that are material to the company is a good place to start. By demonstrating that you're engaging with the process, even with room for improvement, you can help strengthen your company’s reputation in sustainability. Transparency is key.CDP also helps us figure out where to focus our reporting efforts. For example, when new questions are added by CDP, it helps us better understand the importance of certain areas, such as setting short-term or long-term targets or even newer metrics like those related to biodiversity. I don’t mean to downplay the effort it takes to report against CDP and other key reporting frameworks – but the clarity into your own impact areas and progress gained from the process is essential. We’re a team driven by the data. It helps us stay focused on what is material and relevant for our company while also helping us ensure that we’re using our own internal resources appropriately – focusing on what matters most. It’s crucial for us as the ESG team to have access to reliable and consistent data to be able to report performance and set targets with confidence. That’s where our partnership with Greenstone comes in. For the last two years, we have been working with Greenstone to reliably track and organize our GHG data, optimize our data collection process, and accurately report carbon emissions and report through CDP. Greenstone is a Gold CDP Accredited Provider, and that validation gives us – and our company’s leadership - the confidence that we have access to reliable data and methodologies, as well as expert advice around the CDP reporting and submission process. A partnership like this one is essential. To me, it really helps with reporting through CDP, having a partner like Greenstone whose methodology is robust and whose team is accessible and knowledgeable. Setting long-term emissions targets is a crucial part of our environmental strategy, as well as a mechanism for accountability. After establishing our first set of ESG goals in 2021, we are holding ourselves accountable to those goals while progressing toward more ambitious targets. We plan to set goals in line with the latest climate projections, and the Paris Agreement, working through the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). With our emissions calculation through Greenstone’s platform, we completed a reassessment of our 2019 emissions baseline, which will be used as the foundation to set our science-based target within the next year.

73,18/01/2023,44,20,"With 2023 already in full swing, the Greenstone team looks back at the past year in relation to ESG, sustainability and supply chain reporting. There is no doubt that it was a significant year for business and ESG and we anticipate that 2023 will be no different, with greater demand for transparency and accountability. Below we have highlighted five key ESG reporting trends to look out for in 2023. For businesses, mandatory regulation on ESG reporting is coming in thick and fast, both in the EU and in the United States. In the EU, the\xa0Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)\xa0is the latest EU Regulation regarding ESG and non-financial reporting, aiming to speed up EU progress on reaching Net-Zero. It is a step up from the current EU Regulation the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD), expanding the number of mandatory reporting companies from 11,600 to around 49,000. The US is poised for regulation too. The\xa0Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) proposed mandatory climate-risk disclosure rule\xa0will launch in 2023 if approved. In March 2022, the SEC released a new proposal for public companies to begin reporting their carbon emissions and reductions progress alongside their financial results. It requires all filers to disclose Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions that occur onsite and are controlled by the company. As ESG performance becomes a greater focus in the boardroom, companies are having to consider how best to hold themselves accountable. One way to accomplish this is to tie leaders’ compensation to positive ESG outcomes. Companies are increasingly including ESG metrics of some type in their incentive compensation schemes for top executives. In some companies, ESG and sustainability responsibility lies with the full board. Others assign diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&amp;I) and human capital management issues to the human resources committee and sustainability oversight to audit or governance committees. The exact assignments will vary with each company’s specific needs and culture, but it is becoming critical to assign accountability and ensure sufficient governance oversight within a board. Corporate board demographics are changing too. Companies are now looking to assemble boards for ‘tomorrow’, today. For example, recruiting ESG expertise on the board has become critical and hiring has a DE&amp;I lens now more than ever. At the Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC (COP) in 2022, there was an emerging theme of natural capital and the need to prioritise the preservation of biodiversity. The risks resulting from a loss of nature and changes to natural capital have the potential to disrupt society and the stability of the global economy. Whilst most research on financial risks related to natural capital has historically focused on climate change, there is a growing awareness of the risks associated with other aspects of natural capital, such as water stresses, resource scarcity and the loss of biodiversity. Biodiversity-related corporate reporting\xa0is a fast-moving, developing area, and there is ongoing work to create harmonisation, particularly related to measurement and disclosure. Companies should not wait for globally agreed frameworks or perfect tools to be available to approach the topic of biodiversity and nature. Companies should begin to understand and manage biodiversity and nature-related risk and opportunities and to prepare to respond to the introduction of frameworks such as the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD). With more regulation and investor pressure, there is no doubt that companies will need a process to produce high-quality, defensible ESG data that is more aligned with financial reporting requirements. For investors, a company’s ESG performance is only as good as its data quality. Bad quality data can result in inaccurate reporting, lack of transparency, and potential backlash from stakeholders if your efforts are deemed unreliable. Demanding data transparency is the way investors can ensure that the ESG information provided is accurate and not misleading. Advances in technology and software solutions to enable in-depth ESG data analysis are increasing the expectations for ESG data quality and transparency. Once good quality primary data is collected, software solutions enable ESG performance data to be aggregated, compared and benchmarked across various global metrics, KPIs and frameworks.  The reporting of Scope 3 emissions (GHG emissions that are not produced directly from the reporting company but from the activities of its value chain), will continue to rise, and will continue to be a challenging area for many. Communication, collaboration and shared-goals are key to achieving successful Scope 3 disclosure. However, even if you have a high level of buy-in both up and down the value chain, there are still complexities around the data itself and the methodologies used to calculate emissions. Leveraging Scope 3 resources to understand where your material impacts lie, where to start with data collection and how to focus on data quality and coverage over time, will ensure that a journey to reliable Scope 3 data is followed. In summary, what does this mean for businesses and ESG-focused investors? For both groups, requirements to collect, assess and report quality primary ESG data will continue to grow in 2023 and beyond so now is the time to ensure you have future-proof data management processes in place. As the ESG and sustainability reporting landscape grows in complexity and becomes increasingly mainstream, there is a real opportunity for business to improve transparency and demonstrate leadership. Those who don’t address ESG performance – whether it’s across their own operations, their supply chains or their investment portfolio - face getting left behind.",unstructured
74,11/01/2023,39,26,"The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) was founded in 2011 as a not-for-profit, independent standards-setting organisation. SASB’s mission was to establish and maintain industry-specific standards that assist companies in disclosing financially material, decision-useful sustainability information to investors. The SASB Standards identify the subset of environmental, social and governance issues most relevant to financial performance and enterprise value for 77 industries. The Standards were developed using a rigorous and transparent standard-setting process that included: evidence-based research;broad and balanced participation from companies, investors and subject-matter experts; andoversight and approval from the independent SASB Standards Board. Global investors recognise SASB Standards as essential requirements for companies seeking to make consistent and comparable sustainability disclosures. In June 2021, SASB and the International Integrated Reporting Council announced their merger to form the Value Reporting Foundation (VRF). In November 2021, the IFRS Foundation announced it would integrate the VRF and Climate Disclosure Standards Board with its own newly formed International Sustainability Standards Board by June 2022. As of August 2022, the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) of the IFRS Foundation assumed responsibility for the SASB Standards. The ISSB has committed to building on the industry-based SASB Standards and leveraging SASB’s industry-based approach to standards development. The ISSB encourages preparers and investors to continue to provide full support for and to use the SASB Standards until IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards replace SASB Standards. The ISSB is committed to building on the industry-based SASB Standards and embedding SASB’s industry-based approach to standards development. Companies worldwide use SASB standards for their annual reports, financial filings, company websites, sustainability reports, and more. SASB Standards play an important role in the ISSB’s Climate-related Disclosures Exposure Draft and General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information Exposure Draft. Use of SASB Standards, therefore, is good preparation for the implementation of the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards when they are available for use. The ISSB also has committed to enhancing the international applicability of the SASB Standards prior to the effective date of the General Requirements Exposure Draft. SASB Standards can be used to provide a baseline of investor-focused sustainability disclosure and to implement the principles-based framework recommended by the TCFD, which is also incorporated into the ISSB’s Climate Exposure Draft. Similarly, SASB Standards enable robust implementation of the Integrated Reporting Framework, providing the comparability sought by investors. It is useful to understand the difference between sustainability frameworks and sustainability standards. Frameworks are looking to provide principles and guidance for how information is structured and presented in reports. Standards are about ensuring granularity, reliability and comparability of topics for stakeholders, investors and corporates. Discover a list of the key ESG Reporting Frameworks and Standards put together by our team of industry professionals. SASB Standards recognise the sustainability information that is financially material to understanding how a business creates value. That information, also known as ESG information, is used by those who aim to make better financial decisions. Source: sasb.org Impact materiality, which is more comprehensive than SASB Standards, captures the major effects that an organisation has on the economy, environment, and people that are not covered by enterprise value. Users with a range of goals are interested in learning about an organization's positive and negative effects on sustainable development. According to SASB Standards, financial materiality refers to sustainability elements that are important for the short-, medium-, and long-term value of a company. Narrower than SASB Standards: Financial reporting includes estimates of cash flows as well as assumptions that are already reflected in the financial statements. Those whose main goal is to enhance business decisions are the main users. Being a SASB licensee strengthens Greenstone’s position as a global leader in ESG reporting software.

It captures significantly more companies than previous EU regulations have and introduces new mandatory standards. Some non-EU businesses will also be affected. Below we highlight some of the key details to help companies captured under the regulation prepare The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) is the latest EU Regulation regarding Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and non-financial reporting, aiming to speed up EU progress on reaching Net-Zero.

The ESRS are a set of standards that outline the mandatory concepts and principles with which companies reporting under the CSRD must align their sustainability statements. Mandatory reported information includes Double materiality\xa0– impact and financialUpstream and downstream information supply chain information i.e. Scope 3 emissionsSustainability due diligence (relating to the upcoming\xa0Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive\xa0(CS3D))Risks and opportunities arising from ESGE climate change, pollution, water and marine resources, biodiversity and ecosystems, resource use and circular economyS own workers, workers in the value chain, affected communities, consumers and end-usersG governance, risk management and internal control, business conduct For further detail on what is required see in 'Resources' below for ESRS 1 and ESRS 2 If reports do not meet the requirements of the CSRD there is the possibility of sanctions being imposed, it is unknown when these may come into effect. These have not been formalised by the EU, it is likely it will depend on the member state. The ESRS requires the ESG reporting period to be the same as the financial reporting period to allow for reference between the 2 reports. For the first time, it will be mandatory for the report to be verified with a limited level of assurance from a third party, marking a significant positive change in the ESG landscape. Due to the nature of the new regulation, there will be a number of companies captured that have not been mandated to report on areas of ESG performance previously. If this situation applies, the company will need to take steps now to start addressing these needs and to collect the required information from across all operations. FY2024 is fast approaching, therefore processes for reliable sustainability data collection must be put into place as soon as possible. Reviewing the requirements of the CSRD and undertaking a gap analysis will help to determine which non-financial areas are not currently covered by existing reporting processes. Management must commit to increased transparency regarding ESG policy and initiate discussions with third-party auditors. Greenstone’s suite of ESG software solutions enables companies to collect, manage and report all the ESG data, KPIs and metrics required to comply with regulations, including CSRD.

76,14/12/2022,63,39,"The risks resulting from a loss of nature and changes to natural capital have the potential to disrupt society and the stability of the global economy. Whilst most research on financial risks related to natural capital has historically focused on climate change, there is a growing awareness of the risks associated with other aspects of natural capital, such as the loss of biodiversity. In this article, we outline industry trends observed in sustainability reporting of biodiversity and provide a summary of metrics and KPIs to account for biodiversity in sustainability disclosure frameworks. The term\xa0Biodiversity\xa0refers to the variety of life: the diversity of all living organisms from the various ecosystems of the planet. It “includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems” in which they live. The significance of biodiversity is best understood when looking at ecosystem services, which are the benefits humans gain from the natural environment. Businesses depend on ecosystem services because they directly use natural resources and make use of environmental functions such as waste decomposition and detoxification. Ecosystem services depending on biodiversity include: pollinationpest and disease controlfresh watersoil formationand climate regulation. Reduced pollination and declining resilience of ecosystems and species illustrate the consequences of biodiversity loss for economic activity. While determining the exact impact of biodiversity loss on the solidity of financial institutions remains challenging, specific risk channels are clearly identifiable. Biodiversity-related corporate reporting is a fast-moving, developing area, and there is ongoing work to create harmonisation, particularly related to measurement and disclosure. Businesses and financial institutions may experience increased pressure to assess and mitigate their impact on biodiversity. Initiatives are being taken internationally to raise awareness of the ramifications of biodiversity loss, including by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) and the Natural Capital Coalition (NCC). These contribute to an improved understanding of the risks involved. Most recently,\xa0the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), a working group of 35 financial and climate members whose mission is to develop risk management frameworks for climate change,\xa0released a 1st\xa0beta nature framework to help companies move investments away from nature-negative activities. This is aimed to integrate with existing TCFD frameworks alongside new ISSB standards. The\xa0Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD)\xa0was established in response to the growing appreciation of the need to factor nature in financial and business decisions. The TNFD is a global, market-led initiative with the mission to develop and deliver a risk management and disclosure framework for organisations to report and act on evolving nature-related risks and opportunities, with the ultimate aim of supporting a shift in global financial flows away from nature-negative outcomes and toward nature-positive outcomes. In terms of definitions, “nature” includes “biodiversity” along with other parts of the environment. On page 22 of the beta version of the TNFD framework, there is the definition of “nature”: The working definition of nature in the TNFD framework is ‘the natural world, with an emphasis on the diversity of living organisms (including people) and their interactions among themselves and with their environment. People and societies interact with nature and are not separate from it. Nature can be understood through a construct of four realms – Land, Ocean, Freshwater and Atmosphere. The below table lists a draft of TNFD disclosure recommendations to address ecosystem services, so companies can begin to align governance, strategy, and risk management incorporating principles to address nature (including biodiversity): Unlike carbon, biodiversity does not have an intrinsic value and is more complicated to assess.\xa0A key challenge around effectively reporting on a company’s biodiversity impact is that it requires extensive effort to monitor the state and condition of biodiversity at given locations. The following summary describes a few methodologies and guidelines that are being used by businesses and financial institutions to address measuring biodiversity impact. Below are examples of metrics, KPIs, tools and frameworks that account for biodiversity in sustainability disclosure frameworks: Focus on impacts on ecosystems / habitats / land cover:Biodiversity Footprint Financial Institutions (BFFI)Global Biodiversity Score\xa0(GBS)Corporate Biodiversity Footprint (CBS)Focus on species:Species Threat Abatement and Restoration Metric\xa0(STAR)Environmental Profit &amp; Loss (EP&amp;L): Monetary valuesModel or extrapolate biodiversity impacts from indirect environmental pressure data (e.g., GHG emissions and water use):TheProduct Biodiversity Footprint\xa0(PBF)\xa0approach aims to bridge the gap between LCA and ecology.

77,08/12/2022,41,17,"Greenstone attended the recent Responsible Investment Forum in London. Co-hosted with PRI, the Responsible Investment Forum is the longest-running private equity (PE) event focused on bringing together fund managers, institutional investors, and expert advisors to discuss ESG issues across alternative asset classes. Below we identify four key themes during the event: ESG continues to be high on the agenda for PE markets. Many general partners (GPs) are increasingly subject to higher scrutiny and regulatory compliance in an ever-evolving landscape. There is now much more emphasis on creating value through ESG performance, and a step away from the notion of ‘not doing harm’. Although PE firms are uniquely placed to realise ESG opportunities as a key value creation driver, the journey can be challenging and complex. The multiplicity of ESG frameworks, and obtaining reliable data to track performance, remain a challenge. However, as the industry matures, tools are being developed and ‘preferred’ frameworks are being adopted to align expectations. GPs can protect and create long-term value by enhancing value levers and integrating ESG into their value creation plans. Measuring performance against targets and building the knowledge and technology to support and improve those KPIs are key to the success, and sustaining asset value. A growing number of firms are developing decarbonisation strategies and many have set net-zero commitments and science-based targets across their portfolio. For these firms, defining a decarbonisation strategy is the most important starting point. Such a strategy typically involves setting out the overarching ambition and articulating carbon reduction targets, which can be broken down into short- and long-term measures. It is critical to align these targets with the firm’s overall ESG and fund strategy, serving as a guide for limited partners (LPS) and the investment team. However, setting realistic and achievable targets requires accurate measurement of primary data. This requires a streamlined approach to data collection and analysis, as well as portfolio engagement and education. PE firms need to truly engage with their portfolio companies’ management teams and set a clear roadmap. With active engagement at portfolio level, LPs can ensure that these portfolio companies feel part of their investor’s decarbonisation journey and understand what is expected of them year-on-year. Accurate and reliable ESG data is crucial to ensuring firms achieve their targets and create value. This not only relates to decarbonisation and the need for accurate emissions data, but is also true for the entire ESG spectrum. Primary data, sourced directly from portfolio companies, is how reliable value creation can be achieved. Anything else: secondary, or tertiary publicly available data, won’t stand up to scrutiny when it comes to monitoring the progress of targets and performance over time. To report robust and relevant data, LPs need to consider implementing a data strategy that future-proofs their reporting objectives. Embedding a data strategy will enable organisations to define a clear path for data management, facilitate reporting resilience, engage stakeholders, embrace technology and balance short- and long-term reporting effectively. As with any data request, it is essential to communicate what is required clearly but also expand on the when, how and why. Portfolio companies will look to investors for guidance on what is required today, but they also need to understand the context of the broader journey. For many privately held companies, they may not have been required to report on environmental or carbon data previously and as such, an educational element to their engagement is important. A challenge within the PE industry is the concept of letting perfection get in the way of progress. Stakeholders need to understand that perfection isn’t achieved overnight. ESG data is a great starting point and it’s important to have a baseline in order to monitor progress but we’re already seeing signs of ‘greenhushing’ where companies choose to keep their efforts quiet for fear of being accused of greenwashing. While there is a place for blatant greenwashing being exposed, more needs to be done to encourage companies to do their best to improve. ESG and sustainability reporting is a journey and the key to success is measurement of progress and stakeholder buy-in. CEOs and Boards need to be genuinely committed to the goals and need to be educated and informed at every step of the way. ESG software is the obvious way to streamline the ESG data collection, questionnaire distribution and management process. Investors are looking for purpose-built ESG software platforms to collect, track and analyse data and material ESG KPIs from their portfolios on an ongoing basis. Greenstone has been providing sustainability and ESG software solutions for 15+ years. Through its award-winning InvestorPortal software solution, focused on the collection, management and analysis of ESG and carbon data across an investment portfolio, Greenstone is enabling global PE firms to measure the ESG and carbon impact of their portfolios.",unstructured
78,30/11/2022,72,21,"Over the past weeks, Egypt hosted the 27th\xa0UN Conference of the Parties on Climate Change (COP27). The event took place at a resort in Sharm El-Sheikh from November 6th\xa0to the 18th. It brought together over 30,000 policymakers, activists, and scientists with the goal of pushing global and national commitments toward a more sustainable future. The event was split into Thematic Days to provide more focus on an extremely broad topic and agenda. The days included Finance Day, Science Day, Youth &amp; Future Generations Day, Decarbonisation Day, Adaptation &amp; Agriculture Day, Gender Day, Water Day, Ace &amp; Civil Society Day, Energy Day, Biodiversity Day, and Solutions Day. The inclusion of a Youth &amp; Future Generations Day was a novel idea acknowledging that youth play the smallest role in developing climate action plans but will suffer the largest consequences if developed plans are inadequate. In this article, we will consolidate the most relevant events from the different days of COP27 for businesses to consider as 2022 ends and they prepare for a more climate-focused future in 2023 and beyond. The conversations at COP27 can help predict what areas of sustainability will be given the most attention in the coming year and therefore provide important guidance for companies to stay ahead of industry trends. Some important themes from COP27 with implications on business include loss and damage financing, the rejection of greenwashing, the need for a higher carbon price, the rise of offsets, and a focus on biodiversity.   On Monday, November 7th, the first day of the conference, delegates added the issue of ""loss and damage"" to the official summit agenda. Delegates hoped to discuss climate reparations to developing nations given their high vulnerability to climate impacts but low contribution to historical greenhouse gas emissions. By the end of the conference, the first-ever global agreement calling for climate reparations was established. The specifics of how this fund will operate will be laid out at COP28 next year in the United Arab Emirates. When diving into the text in detail, activists note the inclusion of “low-emission” energy as part of the solution. Some may worry this provides a loophole for natural gas and nuclear energy to continue to grow. Nevertheless, the creation of this agreement is a landmark achievement and will result in significant climate-dedicated cash flows to vulnerable nations. The structure of how climate reparations will work will not be set until next year. Therefore, businesses have a year to prepare in anticipation of next year’s COP28 agreement. Businesses can capitalise on the subsequent sustainability opportunities in previously underfunded countries. This agreement could open novel markets for companies in infrastructure, manufacturing, capital goods, and more for expansion and business development. With large sums of cash flowing to previously underfunded regions, companies may find new opportunities in regions not previously anticipated. On Tuesday, November 8th, the UN released a report about greenwashing and its widespread impacts on successful climate action. The UN provides a list of recommendations to ensure developed net zero pledges do not fall for greenwashing pitfalls. An example of one recommendation is the need to establish short- and medium-term absolute emissions reduction targets in addition to ones focused on the long term. Without targets for varying timelines, it is easy to develop unachievable long-term goals. Incremental work ensures companies and local governments continue to push themselves and do not forget about their plans for too long. The release of this report is a reminder that successful climate action requires reliable data to develop reliable plans and set realistic targets. Unreliable data and unrealistic goals provide short-sighted benefits but are extremely detrimental in the long term as companies and local governments try to undo false promises. Only those with legitimate emissions reductions will get to benefit from the positive publicity as governments crack down on greenwashing. Greenwashing is unlikely to be fully quashed any time soon, but in light of COP27, we suggest reviewing your climate goals to ensure they are ambitious but achievable to prevent false promises down the line. We all know inflation is on the rise. However, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the price of carbon also needs to see a significant rise. The IMF says that the carbon price must go up to at least $75/ton by 2030 for global climate goals to succeed. Timely for the European Union, they already established a benchmark price at about 76 euros/tonne. However, the EU is unique in its resolve as the US state of California has carbon allowances selling for just under $30/tonne and many regions have yet to establish a price at all. A carbon price can be established in the form of a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme. Although different in their design and implementation, both follow a structure that forces the original polluter to pay. Businesses that do not reduce their carbon emissions will feel the financial consequences as more regions implement these systems. Getting ahead of regulation is a smart strategy to prevent headaches and unnecessary taxes in the future. We recommend beginning the greenhouse gas accounting journey to start reducing emissions in advance of expensive regulation. During Finance Day, John F. Kerry, the White House climate envoy, outlined the USA’s carbon trading scheme. The voluntary plan aims to expand the sale of carbon credits globally to help boost renewable energy implementation in developing countries. The “Energy Transition Accelerator” will allow companies to claim credits for decarbonisation projects outside national borders and within developing countries. While the plan faced some backlash, its implementation could open opportunities for US companies to focus on clean energy as a means to offset necessary emissions of operations. Broadening beyond the US’s scheme, this COP saw a rise in the legitimacy of offsets. Offsets were pushed aside in past years to focus on other strategies. However, people noted a significant increase in offset conversations throughout COP27. Offset and renewable energy projects can help offset a company’s internal emissions or be sold to other organisations falling short. Although the 27th Conference of the Parties on Climate Change wrapped up this past weekend, the UN’s involvement in sustainability-related conversations is not complete for the year. The UN is hosting COP15, the UN Biodiversity Conference, in Montreal this December. On Wednesday, November 16th, Biodiversity Day of COP27, 350 civil society leaders called on heads of state to prioritise the upcoming event. Nature and biodiversity are becoming key sustainability issues of attention. Companies and governments need to respond and report to relevant frameworks. We see companies increasingly beginning to report on standards and frameworks beyond climate. For example, in 2021 the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) announced a new initiative called the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD). The framework was tested this year and is scheduled to officially launch in 2023. TNFD mimics the structure of TCFD with the intention to help companies and local governments report on the risks associated with biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. We see businesses work towards biodiversity reporting to stay on top of sustainability trends.   The end of COP27 boasts many exciting successes as well as evident shortcomings. Regardless of your perspective of the size of its impact, COP27, like all of the COPs before it, will push companies and governments in specific areas they hadn’t previously intended. COP27 was another step in highlighting the crucial need for delivery on climate action. Based on speeches of political leaders and reports presented, a world of climate related-regulation is coming into clearer focus. Global enforcement is not coming anytime soon but specific nations and regions are setting ambitious goals for themselves. Businesses can prepare for regulation in their operating regions today by beginning their GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions reporting journey if they haven’t already. However, before diving into reducing a business’s emissions, a company needs a solid grasp of how much they are emitting and where it is originating.",unstructured
79,24/11/2022,30,17,"Greenstone has been working with the Davines Group to help streamline data collection and automate carbon emissions calculation and reporting. Through the use of Greenstone’s sustainability reporting software, Davines has been able to automate the GHG emissions calculation process and access the accurate data required to assess ambitious commitments and targets. Read the project case study below. The Company Headquartered in Parma, Italy, the Davines Group consists of two brands, Davines which is dedicated to professional hairdressing and Comfort Zone dedicated to the professional skincare market. The Davines Group became B Corp certified in 2016 and currently operates in about 90 countries globally. The Challenge Since its first sustainability report in 2015, the Davines Group had experienced significant growth, in both business and employee numbers. With several offices located across the world and its products being available to purchase in 90 countries, collecting information and qualified data across the entire business was a big challenge. Davines had also set ambitious commitments and targets, including committing to a science-based target through the SBTi and re-certifying as a B Corporation. So, the volume of data that they needed to collect and manage in order to understand and report their social and environmental impacts became unmanageable using previous manual processes. The Solution In 2021, Greenstone partnered with Davines to implement its Enterprise software solution across the Davines Group to help streamline data collection and automate carbon emissions calculation and reporting. Both the Environment and Frameworks The Environment module automates Davines’ GHG emissions calculation – across all relevant Scope 1, 2 and 3 categories - and provides customisable\xa0dashboards where the team can view consumption data and the associated emissions by office\xa0or group-wide during any time period. Dashboards can be easily exported for use in external reports or internal communications. There is also a variance\xa0tracker which enables users to quickly identify and\xa0resolve any anomalies in this data. Through the Frameworks module, Davines distribute a comprehensive set of customised sustainability questionnaires across the business. Specific users are assigned to specific metrics, which is particularly useful for content that follows strict privacy policies. The data collected through this module is used to complete Davines’ B Corp certification questionnaire on an ongoing basis. There is also an automated data-feed set-up which integrates the Greenstone solution with Davines’ internal business systems. This integration automatically populates relevant areas of the Greenstone sustainability metrics to ensure an accurate, reliable and timely set of data.

80,16/11/2022,31,14,"With reporting requirements constantly increasing, a huge volume of data needs to be collected and reported across an organisation. Once collected, you are then faced with the daunting task of combining datasets from different business functions into something that can be interpreted, analysed and reported on. As data gets more complex, using spreadsheets becomes cumbersome and there is a point where spreadsheets simply cannot handle the volume of data you need to report as part of your sustainability and ESG strategy. Greenstone, through its award-winning sustainability and ESG software, enables its clients to move away from spreadsheet outputs and time-consuming data collection; to in-depth reporting and analysis and real decision-making. Based on our experience of helping our clients do this, below we have outlined five reasons why spreadsheets are not fit to manage your sustainability data. It is likely that you will be dealing with large volumes of sustainability and ESG data collected from a long list of sources across your organisation. Putting all this data into a single spreadsheet can be a problem as Excel struggles with large file sizes. Whilst you can enter large volumes of data into Excel, you will find yourself waiting for ages for it to perform even the simplest calculations and the files can be unstable and can easily crash. Another factor that will affect the performance of your spreadsheet is the number of formulas and conditional formatting you use. As the complexity of your sustainability and ESG reporting increases with larger and larger datasets, you will find your formula-rich spreadsheets performing very slowly and eventually crashing. One of the most limiting factors when using spreadsheets to manage your sustainability and ESG data is the lack of multiple user access options. Excel was never built for multiple users and even with modern versions, it is completely impractical to have more than a limited number of users access a spreadsheet at once. Even with a small number of users accessing a single file at one time, there is an increased danger of data loss. Excel can produce a number of reports, graphs and charts but they are limited and can easily become detached from automatic updates without clear indication. Sustainability and ESG software can automatically produce reports for internal reporting purposes, as well as global ESG and sustainability reporting frameworks e.g. CDP, GRI, SASB, TCFD, DJSI and ISO, at the click of a button. The same goes for dashboards; Excel doesn’t come with dashboards, whereas sustainability management software comes packed with a variety of intuitive and customisable dashboards that multiple stakeholders within an organisation, whether software users or not, can access and easily understand. Excel spreadsheets are inherently more unstable compared to other software solutions, so there is a much higher likelihood of data corruption. This can pose a serious risk if you are reliant on Excel as your main data calculation tool, even if you do create regular backups. Software-as-a-Service provides daily customer data backups and offsite storage in secure locations for longer retention. Purpose-built sustainability management software is designed to be used for managing sustainability and ESG data and therefore the functionality tends to be intuitive, built for purpose and easy to use. Examples of this include industry-specific calculations, such as parallel GHG calculations across location-based, residual-mix and market-based emissions reporting coming as standard functionality. In Excel, you’ll have to build all this functionality into your spreadsheet yourself, which can take quite a lot of work and a good degree of training to use.   Greenstones software provides a central online platform to collect, manage, analyse and report sustainability and ESG data across a complex global organisation.\xa0It has won numerous industry awards including\xa0the ´Technology: ESG´ award at The Drawdown Awards ceremony, for our investor ESG solution, InvestorPortal, and Top Product of the Year 2021 award by Environment + Energy Leader for the fourth consecutive year.

81,02/11/2022,26,14,"EY recently released a survey on 'Building supply chain sustainability that can drive revenues and reduce operational risks'. This survey of senior supply chain executives shows the need for a holistic and ROI-backed roadmap to meet sustainability performance goals. The survey was based on the following: EY teams surveyed 525 executives about their sustainable supply chain practices. Many have long-term strategies but struggle to measure their progress.Business case initiatives for sustainability stretch beyond cost savings to increased revenue, customer loyalty and share price.To reap the benefits now and in the long term, companies should align to science-based targets and begin work to define and achieve those goals.  Below is a summary of the key findings of the\xa0EY teams 2022\xa0survey: EY teams 2022 survey reveals that visibility throughout the supply chain is this year’s top priority for supply chain executives, having been a top-two priority for them in 2021 and 2019. Further, there is a critical need for executives to assess risks, plan for disruptions, and even better, to avoid them. And although increased end-to-end supply chain visibility is a top priority, it remains a work in progress—only about four\xa0in 10 respondents (37%) have seen increasing visibility. In one notable finding, EY teams research revealed that 33% of companies lack a business case for sustainable supply chains and nearly half of respondents said their\xa0companies are struggling to measure the return on sustainable supply chain activities. A lack of business case to support expenditures and processes to track sustainability improvements may stall funding support for future initiatives. Cost savings and efficiency were cited as the top motivators for embarking on supply chain sustainability by 61% of companies. However, financial performance is not the only benefit to expect. As a result of their ESG initiatives, 55% of supply chain executives say they expect to see better management of operational risks within the next one to three years, adding to the 20% who have already seen these reductions. While 31% have already experienced enhanced efficiency and productivity, 51% expect to see that in the next one to three years. In the longer term, three to five years, 54% of respondents expect increased share price or other indicators of shareholder value. While supply chain sustainability goals will look different for each company, EY teams offer five actions to get started. Determine how sustainable supply chains fit into your organisational-wide commitments and goals to help prioritise your efforts. EY teams recommend first looking at organisation materiality, supplier risk assessments and organisational commitment, for example science-based target (SBT) activation, supplier diversity, human rights, etc., and then determining which goals the supply chain activates.Improve the visibility and traceability of your supply chain.Deploy technological capabilities to help improve Tier-n visibility and supplier engagement. Communicate often with stakeholders through broader data sharing and collaboration tools.Expand your ROI measurement to include intangible impacts and sustainability outcomes.Think about business-case drivers beyond cost savings, including revenue, market share, reduced risk and improved customer and employee loyalty.Move beyond a sourcing and procurement focus to capture benefits across the end-to-end supply chain.\xa0Enterprises should take an end-to-end approach, including planning, sourcing, manufacturing, and logistics and distribution. Cross-functional collaboration with other functions such as finance, risk and more can broaden opportunities for business benefits.Leverage available tax incentives and grants.Review your sustainability initiatives for cost benefits and tax impact.

82,26/10/2022,24,17,"The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recently published their fifth annual status report. This report reflects on milestones related to the implementation of the TCFD recommendations since they were released in 2017 and other encouraging developments in climate-related disclosure since their last report in October 2021. TCFD's 2022 Status Report provides an overview of current disclosure practices in terms of their alignment with the Task Force’s recommendations. It also highlights progress associated with the implementation of the TCFD recommendations over the past five years — including progress relative to key milestones identified in 2017, implementation trends and challenges that may be useful for companies beginning to implement the recommendations, and investors and other users’ views on the usefulness of climate-related financial disclosures and improvements needed. For the fiscal year 2021 reporting, 80% of companies disclosed in line with at least one of the 11 recommended disclosures; however, only 4% disclosed in line\xa0with all 11 recommended disclosures and only around 40% disclosed in line with at least five. In particular, the average level of disclosure across the 11 recommended disclosures for European companies was 60% for the fiscal year 2021, growing 23 percentage points since the fiscal\xa0year 2019; 36% for Asia Pacific companies — an increase of 11 percentage points; and 29% for North America companies — an increase of 12 percentage points. Over 60% of asset managers and over 75% of asset owners surveyed indicated they currently report climate-related information to their clients and beneficiaries, respectively. The majority\xa0of asset managers report through sustainability reports or directly to clients, while the majority of asset owners report through annual, sustainability, or climate-specific reports. Based on survey responses, 60% of asset managers and nearly 80% of asset owners indicated they report information aligned\xa0with at least one recommended disclosure, whereas only 9% of asset managers and 36% of asset owners report on 10 recommended disclosures. None indicated they report on all 11. Based on the TCFD survey, over 70% of companies implementing the TCFD recommendations disclosed climate-related information in financial filings or annual reports (including integrated reports) for the fiscal year 2021 compared to 45% for the fiscal year 2017. Ninety-five per cent (95%) of survey respondents saw an increase in the availability of climate-related financial disclosures since the release of the TCFD recommendations, with 88% of respondents citing improvements in the quality of disclosures. Based on the TCFD survey, 90% of investors and other users incorporate climate-related financial disclosures in financial decision-making, and 66% of these indicated such disclosures factor into the way they price financial assets.16 In addition, based on a literature review, there is a growing body of evidence that climate-related risks are beginning to affect prices for certain types of assets. Conclusion and Next Steps Overall, the Task Force is encouraged by companies’ progress in disclosing climate-related financial information aligned with the TCFD recommendations and by the support of regulators and standard setters in using the recommendations as a basis to develop laws, rules, and standards on climate-related financial disclosure. Nevertheless, the Task Force remains concerned that not enough companies are disclosing decision-useful climate-related financial information, which may hinder investors, lenders, and insurance underwriters’ efforts to appropriately assess and price climate-related risks. This is supported by the analysis summarised in this report as well as broader assessments on the state of climate change, including those in the IPCC’s April 2022 report.

Over the next several months, the Task Force will continue to monitor companies’ progress in disclosing climate-related financial information aligned with the TCFD recommendations and will prepare another status report for the Financial Stability Board in October 2023. About the TCFD The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) works to improve and increase reporting of climate-related financial information. In 2017, the TCFD released climate-related financial disclosure recommendations designed to help companies provide better information to support informed capital allocation. Nearly 4,000 organizations around the world have declared support for the TCFD and its recommendations.",unstructured
83,05/10/2022,110,49,"Despite growing stakeholder pressure, many companies still do not have an understanding of the compliance, potential risks and impacts of their supply chain. We believe that companies are on an ever-maturing supplier management journey. The ultimate goal of this journey is to integrate sustainable supplier management across their business, in order to create more transparent, responsible and risk-free supply chains. Supply chain risk can be classified as operational, financial, regulatory, and reputational. These are very strong drivers for the adoption of more sustainable supply chain practices. The key risk that ensures action at all levels of an organisation is financial, and it could be argued that operational, regulatory and reputational risks all impact the bottom line if they are not realised. When we talk about the risk management journey, what we mean is that all types of risks are considered and addressed at each stage of the supplier engagement and management process. At every stage of this journey, risk is a key driver for improved performance, and as such should be incorporated into all processes and decisions in order to unlock the strategic and operational benefits of more symbiotic supplier relationships. At Greenstone, we provide a sustainability supply chain software solution – SupplierPortal - and supporting services to enable responsible supply chains. When we engage with our clients, we look to make engaging suppliers and identifying and remediating risk as simple as possible. As with any project, breaking it down into manageable work streams helps simplify it and ensure continual progress. We break the project down into the stages of implementing our supply chain management software solution\xa0SupplierPortal\xa0and ensure that risk is fully addressed and discussed at each stage. Very simply, the risk journey is an acknowledgement of the potential risks that you should be aware of at every stage of setting up an effective supplier management programme. Below we detail these 5 key steps of the risk journey. For each step, we outline the specific risks the step addresses and practical tips on where to start. This is exactly the way in which we work with our clients during the implementation of our supply chain management software solution SupplierPortal – ensuring we address risk at every stage.   The risks: The risks that organisations are exposed to through ineffective supplier engagement are significant. Without a successful supplier engagement phase, you are not going to obtain the data that creates transparency and drives the decisions. You also only really get one opportunity to carry out this process properly, as you don’t want to frustrate suppliers with continued failed and half-hearted engagement attempts. Other material risks at this stage are depressed response rates and supplier churn. A failure to achieve desired response rates means swathes of incomplete data and unknown risks.\xa0And similarly, a process which doesn’t account for new suppliers and removes old suppliers results in the same information gaps and confused data sets. Where to start: One of the most common questions asked by organisations engaging their suppliers for the first time, is “who should I target?”. Well firstly, it is worth reviewing and understanding your supplier list. It can become apparent with a deeper look that a supplier list is not up to date and accurate, many listed suppliers are no longer suppliers and from our experience, the actual list is anywhere between 40 – 70 % smaller. This makes an enormous difference when planning your approach, as we would always argue that from a risk perspective you need almost the entire supplier coverage. How we can help: We have multiple clients who distribute their supplier code of conduct through SupplierPortal. These are mandated for all suppliers, and so there is really no reason why you should not be looking to achieve basic compliance across all of your suppliers. Sadly, the risk to your business is unlikely to conveniently sit within 20% of suppliers that represent 80% of your spending. Therefore, you need to avoid a lack of meaningful coverage, and if you do try a different approach then don’t take a simple cross-section of suppliers but apply geographical, legislative and spend filters to identify ‘high’ risk suppliers. Always think is your approach well thought through and defensible to an auditor.   The risks: Hand in hand with supplier engagement goes data requirements. Risks at this stage include poor response rates, and out-of-date information, again leading to a lack of meaningful data. You also risk creating incomparable, irrelevant or inaccessible data which limits its utility. Where to start: Whilst identifying who your suppliers are and what categories they sit in, you also need to understand what it is you are going to ask them. The information you require from a supplier will undoubtedly be linked to their geography and the service they provide and as a result of these, the legislation or certification requirements that apply. If correctly distributed to suppliers, your data sets should be relevant and therefore be comparable within your supplier categories. You should also be careful not to ask for any information that you will not use. The content can and will evolve over time, so there is no need to overburden a supplier in phase one of your strategy. How we can help : All of our clients use SupplierPortal to engage suppliers on multiple topic areas. Generally speaking, there is a need for common information across all suppliers e.g. code of conduct and policy-related e.g. sustainability content, with some specific content from certain supplier categories. All of this can be managed using supply chain software with planning and an awareness of how you want to use the information you are gathering. If you have not thought about how you wish to access and utilise the information which you have gathered, then you may not understand if you have the correct systems and processes in place to produce effective results.   The risks: Too often suppliers are engaged, information is gathered and then nothing is done. The effect of this is twofold, suppliers can become disenchanted with the process and believe they have wasted their time, which can affect ongoing compliance. Perhaps even more importantly, however, is the fact that risks remain unidentified and unaddressed. Not only this but you risk legal culpability by having asked the question of the supplier but having done nothing about it. Where to start: You need to clearly understand what constitutes a high (or multiple categories) risk response and a non-compliance. A non-compliance is often simple, such as a policy or certificate which has not been provided. However, when it comes to an area like labour rights or forced labour, it could be that response, or a combination of responses, are indicative of risk and should be investigated further. Understanding this before you review the data for the first time will streamline the process and enable more effective automation of the data analysis. How we can help: Naturally, the challenge has always been to find the resource to continually evaluate suppliers. However, this is where software tools can provide automation both to immediately assess a supplier’s response and to also monitor their performance on an ongoing basis. This enables central teams to deal with exceptions rather than manually reviewing each individual response. Software is never a silver bullet though, and that is why we put so much emphasis on how you engage suppliers and what you ask them to create meaningful data sets.   The risks: It is one thing to create a robust and efficient supplier review process, but it is another thing to act on it. The ability to mitigate and remediate risk across your suppliers is what we have been building towards throughout this risk journey. The obvious risks in not being able to do so are that you have known risks that remain open, and you continue to use suppliers that remain non-compliant or do not meet the standards expected of your organisation, your customers and your investors. Not only this but the failure to effectively remediate these risks undermines belief in the value of the process and is something that will be picked by auditors. Where to start: The challenges at this stage relate to communication and scale and the difficulty of combining the two. You need to engage individual suppliers in dialogue on the risks that have been identified, create an action plan, set deadlines, and track the remediation process. As with the identification of risk, this is a process that consumes huge amounts of resources if it cannot be automated. Once again the capacity to do this effectively is increased by good planning around what information is gathered from which suppliers, and clearly identifying what constitutes a risk. How we can help: We have touched on the need for central teams to only deal with exceptions, and in this way, a large number of suppliers can automatically be reviewed using software and the risks identified. However, when you are dealing with large volumes of suppliers the number of exceptions i.e. risks and non-compliances can still be very large. Again automation of the process is key. Our clients utilise our risk management tool to automatically create actions for suppliers that have triggered defined types of risk. These actions are sent to suppliers with automated notifications, deadlines, and direct messaging services streamlining the process. The key is that a small team can manage the supplier action plans by clearly understanding what activity needs to happen in the system at any given time.   The risks: The final piece of an effective supplier management programme is to ensure that the process that has been put in place for engaging suppliers (especially new suppliers), distributing relevant questionnaire content, reviewing data, and remediating risk, is fit for ongoing use. The key risk of not having an ongoing process in place is that the data evolves. Supplier responses change over time and you need to be aware of this, time-critical documentation can expire, and new suppliers, come on board and need to be put through the same review process. All of this requires a continual review of the data and ideally automated notification when new exceptions occur. However, perhaps one of the key risks is new legislation. The risk is twofold. Either you are unaware of the legislation which opens up a clear issue of compliance, or your process is not flexible enough to accommodate changes in content, supplier responses and so on. Without a clear understanding of the status of your suppliers at any given time, the potential for risks to go undetected increases exponentially. Also, if you do not have an efficient ongoing process, instead of dealing with a manageable amount of exceptions on an ongoing basis, you are stockpiling issues that will require a heavy lift further down the line. Where to start: Hopefully, if you have addressed most of what we have covered so far when implementing your supplier management process then this stage is about drawing on all of that good work. Those areas of the business that have contributed to questionnaire content, should be aware that any changing legislation should be fed into the process. If it is urgent to get updated supplier responses then you need a simple way of communicating this to suppliers. If you have been running the supplier review process as a one-off then the resource used may not be prepared for ongoing workloads. So if you have had a successful first phase of data review, this same process should be deployed on an ongoing basis. From the supplier perspective, you need to ensure that supplier information is continually updated and doesn’t become meaningless. How we can help: Greenstone works with its clients to build long-term supplier management processes that address and reduce risk, both now and in the future. As discussed in the introduction, we recognise that clients are on a journey and therefore the requirements change over time. This could be a result of internal drivers or external factors such as legislation. We ensure that the software put in place can evolve with them. This means that content can easily be altered, response frequencies can be set for suppliers, and importantly automated analysis and notifications continually drive up-to-date information.",unstructured
84,08/09/2022,29,19,"Measuring and reducing Scope 3 emissions (GHG emissions associated with the value chain) has become a key area of environmental reporting for most companies. With a surge in the setting of ambitious science-based and net-zero targets, and the increased pressure from investors, regulators and customers,\xa0prioritising Scope 3 emissions has never been as important. This article presents a practical case study on how companies are approaching the Scope 3 reporting journey and the common three stages we are seeing the vast majority of our clients, across all industries and all sizes of organisations, go through when it comes to Scope 3 reporting.  Stage one When a company has been initially measuring and reporting carbon emissions with a focus on accurate Scope 1 and 2 emissions. For Scope 3 in this stage, generally, people are only focusing on the core Scope 3 categories, or the ones that are straightforward and within their control. This would typically be waste from locations, sites or offices, business travel, and maybe some parts of category three for fuel and energy-related activities. Stage two This stage is where we are seeing the wider Scope 3 picture starting to come together, but still in a high-level way. This is when the emissions-screening process would take place and would be where a company still relies on spend data to start assessing wider Scope 3 categories but using this to understand where the material impact areas are. From here, the number of Scope 3 categories starts to grow. Typically, this starts with purchased goods and services and capital goods. Stage three This is the stage where the focus really switches onto the quality of data and the reliance on spending data reduces as companies reach out to suppliers to get more accurate primary data. From here, the categories being tracked, continue to increase. Although it's likely at this stage that a company will be aiming to track all categories that are relevant to them, it depends on the industry, which will determine which categories will be relevant. For example, a company that creates products and sells products will need to be much more focused on these categories from the outset. Similarly, companies that have material investments or franchises will look to engage in those categories earlier in their reporting. Greenstone’s suite of sustainability, supply chain and investor ESG software solutions provide an integrated approach to addressing the challenge of Scope 3 emissions calculation and reporting. Providing a central hub for the collection and aggregation of Scope 3 data across all 15 Scope 3 categories, Greenstone’s solutions support businesses on their Scope 3 reporting journey, whether they are just starting out or they have been reporting in this area for years. In Stage one and Stage two outlined above, our clients are mainly using our ESG software platform (Greenstone Enterprise) to coherently streamline data from within their operations across Scope 3. In Stage three, as we start to get a combination of primary data from suppliers or investments, we then transition into using Greenstone’s other solutions as well. This is where our clients are using SupplierPortal and InvestorPortal to collect primary data from their suppliers and portfolio companies and automate the collection of data for an accurate Scope 3 emissions inventory. SupplierPortal and InvestorPortal GHG wizards can be used to collect primary carbon data from external organisations. The GHG emissions wizards are a dedicated Scope 3 functionality in those two solutions, that can be used by companies to push out requests to suppliers or investments to collect primary Scope 3 data.",unstructured
85,24/08/2022,72,40,"Greenstone recently held a webinar, in partnership with the Sustainable Purchasing Leadership Council (SPLC), on the ‘Dynamic ESG landscape &amp; its intersections with sustainable procurement’. In this blog, we have summarised one topic that was covered in the webinar – how Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) disclosure impacts procurement teams. Below are 4 key impacts of ESG disclosure and reporting on procurement teams. The increasing requirement to use frameworks and standards to disclose corporate ESG data means that there's more supplier data needed. Supply chains are an increasingly integral part of ESG reporting. This means that its more important than ever that companies can demonstrate a robust approach to assessing, managing and improving your suppliers’ ESG performance. Impact on procurement: Procurement teams are a key stakeholder in engaging suppliers Procurement is the area of the business with the most experience in engaging with suppliers and should therefore be a key stakeholder in defining how suppliers can be engaged most effectively. Often this is by building on existing processes in relationships and if procurement is not involved in this initial phase of integrating ESG into purchasing and supply management then it's likely that the long-term success of the programme is in jeopardy. Identification of relevant suppliers When starting supplier ESG programmes, it's often necessary to identify relevant or material suppliers. Procurement is key to this process and may be asked to provide supplier data sets that can support and inform the process. For example, this could be supplier categories, supplier spend or indirect versus direct suppliers. The more up to date and centralised these records are, the smoother the processes of identifying and engaging with the suppliers. Front line of supplier support When defining the approach to capturing ESG metrics from suppliers, it's also important to understand who's going to be supporting the suppliers through this process. It's likely that buyers or category managers within procurement will end up as the first line of support. If that happens, they need to understand what is being asked of the suppliers and why. Contractual obligations with suppliers Any requests for information or change in supplier due diligence is intrinsically linked to the agreements that you have in place with your suppliers. Therefore, it is important that supplier contracts reference ESG and disclosure requirements. These agreements are a key mechanism in achieving high levels of supplier engagement. Conversely, existing agreements may also impact the type of approach you can take with certain suppliers in terms of addressing ESG. Overall, procurement is likely to be responsible for reviewing existing agreements, updating contracts and ensuring that they get put in place with suppliers.   Another way in which procurement is impacted by the increasing need for ESG reporting in supply chain is through the interactions within an organisation. Accountability for supply chain sustainability is typically shared out across the business. As discussed, procurement need to support the design of the process, support suppliers and also review contractual agreements. Source: UN Global Compact – The state of sustainable supply chains  The above diagram indicates that the responsibility can also extend to legal risk marketing, finance, as well as sustainability and procurement. The nature and scope of ESG data coupled with the rising importance of ESG disclosure globally, we can see how ESG risks can become legal, financial and reputational risks to the companies and therefore involve multiple teams within a business. Impact on procurement: More engagement and ‘collaboration’ across companies As a result of the shared accountability, procurement will likely enjoy greater visibility within the organisation and therefore have to interact in more frequent and more dynamic ways with colleagues. It's important to translate this engagement into collaboration, rather than anything negative. Otherwise, the sharing of data and ideas is unlikely to take place. ESG teams now define supplier information requests ESG teams will increasingly want to define what information suppliers need to provide and they'll also need to access that data. It is important that systems that enable this, work for both procurement and the wider business. Single records of suppliers’ data and auditable databases of supplier interactions will be key to managing not only the increasing volumes of data, but increasing engagement with the suppliers. Procurement gatekeepers to the relationships – should this change? Procurement have historically been gatekeepers to suppliers. There is a question as to whether this remains in place when organisations are now thinking of suppliers as an extension of their business. Procurement should continue to take a leading role, but ESG and sustainability teams are now increasingly forming an integral part of the ongoing supplier management and review process. Understanding ESG team's requirements Procurement needs to understand the ESG team’s needs. It helps to understand the constant evolution of the ESG framework landscape and that they are under pressure from clients, investors and other stakeholders to provide this information. The incorporation of ESG data into purchasing decisions and management process fundamentally impacts how procurement select suppliers and assess them on an ongoing basis. Impact on procurement: Skills and knowledge needed to interpret data Companies need supplier data to make the decisions and improve performance, but they also need the skills and knowledge to interpret the data. When making at purchasing decisions based on ESG, data collection and interpretation can be done through a deep integration between sustainability and procurement. Or in other cases, it can be achieved through clearly scored outputs from supplier assessments that enable procurement to add ESG into any decision-making process with confidence. Standardisation key for comparability Standardisation is key for comparability across suppliers, but different categories of suppliers or products are often going to be assessed on different aspects of ESG. It’s important the requested data is relevant to the supplier category and procurement is aware of why the same metrics might be weighted differently. Ongoing ESG performance and change over time The key challenge for procurement is that companies need to demonstrate improvement over time in relation to ESG performance. It's no longer enough to have static disclosures from suppliers, companies need to demonstrate where they've come from and where they're going and this will need to feed into the wider supplier performance review process. The heightened profile of ESG within businesses is resulting in increased exposure and responsibility for procurement teams. Impact on procurement: ESG now has board level representation Climate change is one of the biggest financial risks to multinational companies and ESG is increasingly being represented at board level. At C suite level, we're increasingly seeing reports of remuneration being tied to ESG performance of the organisation. And we are likely to see this cascading down through all levels of the procurement teams. Procurement intrinsically linked to ESG disclosure As highlighted by the global pandemic, sustainable supply chains are integral to forming resilient organisations and as such are a key metric for strong ESG performance. As a result, procurement will be involved far more in both company reporting and contributing to winning new business, as supply chain processes and supplier ESG will be a key element to both. Increased responsibility placed on procurement teams Supply chains now represent a higher reputational and compliance risk to businesses than ever before. This both increases the importance of procurement integrating ESG in to all practices, but it also dramatically increases the responsibility on those involved. With ESG reporting being at the forefront of customers, consumers, employees and investors meaningful ESG data and interpretation of the data is more important than ever.",unstructured
86,10/08/2022,40,22,"There is both a significant need as well as a significant challenge in understanding an organisation’s value chain (or scope 3) emissions. One of the key challenges is understanding which of the\xa0GHG Protocol 15 scope 3 categories\xa0apply to your organisation, and of these which are going to be material to your overall scope 3 emissions footprint. In this article, we are going to be focussing on one of the most common sources of scope 3 emissions, which is an organisation’s suppliers. Supplier emissions account for a large proportion of upstream emissions and often fall into Category 1: Purchased goods and services, but can be associated with any of the Categories 1 – 8. For example, emissions from the transportation of purchased products from a tier-one supplier to a reporting company, in unowned or controlled vehicles, are accounted for in Category 4: Upstream transportation and distribution. Similarly, emissions related to fuel and energy purchased from suppliers by the reporting company fall under Category 3: Fuel and energy-related activities. We will focus predominantly on Category 1: Purchased goods and services, as this category, includes all upstream emissions from the production of products, both goods and services, purchased by the reporting company.   There are multiple methods for calculating supplier emissions, and these are broadly split into two approaches - those that require information directly from the supplier and those that use secondary data. The GHG Protocol defined supplier-specific and hybrid methods, both involve the collection of data directly from suppliers. The supplier-specific approach generally relies on product level consumption data, whereas the hybrid method uses supplier data to calculate scope 1 and 2 emissions, but allocates these emissions based on spend and product purchased, for example. Secondary data can be used to plug gaps where information is not available from the suppliers themselves. Average-data and spend-based methods rely solely on secondary data, estimating emissions based on industry and material averages.   Engaging with suppliers directly poses a number of challenges to the reporting organisation in terms of resources and cost. This is why it is crucial to understand which sources of scope 3 emissions are material, and therefore which represent opportunities for reduction. Even within an organisation’s supply chain, deploying different calculation approaches can provide accuracy in categories where emissions are greatest and reduce the resource required in others. In addition to potentially creating more accurate data, capturing supplier information directly ensures that suppliers can become educated and engaged in the emissions calculation process. It also provides the reporting organisation with a means to assist the supplier organisation in their own environmental reporting and to collaborate on ways to reduce emissions related to their commercial relationship and beyond. Average data methods are suited to ensuring the greatest possible coverage of supplier emissions, meaning that overall scope 3 emissions can be reported and short, medium and long-term targets set. However, if primary supplier data is not also utilised then the reporting organisation has very few options for reducing scope 3 emissions. For example, supplier emissions that are calculated solely on spending associated with purchased goods and services can only be reduced by reducing this spending. The calculation methods adopted can therefore either improve or constrain an organisation’s ability to meet Science-Based Targets or track the correct net-zero pathway. In order to ensure a scalable, robust and auditable process for addressing scope 3 emissions, it is extremely likely that organisations will need the support of a software solution. An offline approach represents a serious resource commitment and significant potential for errors. Utilising software for calculating and managing scope 3 emissions in the supply chain will enable reporting organisations to engage more effectively with larger numbers of suppliers and simplify the process of emissions reporting. Both buyers and suppliers are likely to be tackling this for the first time, and so will need a solution that is both scalable and that can evolve with their needs. Greenstone has a suite of software solutions designed to assist organisations in their scope 3 emissions management. Our Enterprise Environment module, SupplierPortal and InvestorPortal solutions all utilise the maintained Greenstone GHG emission factor library of over 1 million emission factors to ensure accurate emissions calculation. All of our solutions are also integrated to ensure that emissions data can be automatically shared between them. SupplierPortal, for example, contains customisable GHG emission calculation wizards which can be distributed to suppliers in a targeted manner, with resulting emissions data automatically included in the reporting organisation’s overall scope 1, 2 and 3 footprints for management, target setting and performance tracking. All emissions data captured in the Greenstone ecosystem can be assigned to any scope 3 GHG categories at a data source level. Meaning that individual supplier emissions can be assigned to multiple categories for accurate reporting. Within SupplierPortal, suppliers can also be categorised, for example, to differentiate between production-related products (e.g. materials, components, and parts) and non-production-related products (e.g. office furniture, office supplies, IT support). This ensures that suppliers can be engaged and assessed in a targeted manner in order to collect the most relevant emission-related data in the most appropriate way.",unstructured
87,28/07/2022,49,25,"Since the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposal in March 2022, public companies are expecting to begin reporting their carbon emissions and reductions progress alongside their financial results.\xa0Greenstone is covering the progress of the proposal and has produced a series of resources on what to look out for ahead of the final vote. This blog covers the key takeaways on the SEC's new proposal, the answers to some frequently asked questions and how Greenstone’s software can help start preparations. Key Takeaways on the SEC’s Proposed Rule This proposal is part of a much larger global movement, as international Governments are demanding more transparency and more climate action. It is clear that the regular disclosure of emissions and reductions plans is here to stay. While some of the new reports required by the SEC may not be due until 2024, many companies aren’t waiting to get started. Many investors are asking for the climate data now, and companies that have it and can manage it easily with software – such as Greenstone’s enterprise product - will both be able to answer those questions and get a head start on what’s to follow. This new ruling will help to centralise climate risks in decision making for companies and is driven by the demands of shareholders and investors for companies to consider climate reporting as a smart business decision. If you are a public company, you’ll need to start preparing to meet the proposed SEC disclosure requirements. But keep in mind that even if you have a private company, you’re competing against public companies who will need to meet these new requirements, in a marketplace that increasingly expects ESG disclosures from businesses. Therefore, while the takeaways mostly apply to public companies, all companies should give them strong consideration. Get organised. Your company may already be conducting an internal analysis of their GHG emissions and their materiality to business or may have publicly announced GHG reduction goals. If so, you already have a good foundation to build on to facilitate public sharing of metrics and details they already track internally. Expect more focus on ESG. More stakeholders, including regulators, investors, and members of the general public, are demanding accountability and transparency when it comes to ESG. The SEC is likely to continue to expand its concept of materiality and its disclosure requirements. Improve your GHG management. Many organisations struggle to report GHG emissions, especially Scope 3. Greenstone’s software solutions can simplify this task by providing a common platform for tracking all three scopes of GHGs and aligning your reporting with common disclosure frameworks. Learn more here: Fact Sheet - SEC's Proposed Climate Disclosure Requirements FAQs:  How will the new rule affect how we calculate carbon footprints? The SEC rules are almost entirely aligned with the GHG Protocol, it is unlikely that you will have to change your existing approach to emissions if you are already calculating your emissions and using this methodology. However, it is advised that you check whether your current Scope 1 &amp; 2 emissions boundary, as well as your Scope 3 emissions, includes all entities in your consolidated financial statements. This will help to future-proof your footprint and better align it with your financial reporting. Does the proposal include an auditing requirement? The proposal includes an auditing requirement from a neutral, trusted, and experienced third party covering, at a minimum, the disclosure of the company\'s Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (everything except Scope 3 disclosures). Third-party attestation auditing requirement will phase in over two years, and will only apply to accelerated filers and large accelerated filers. This report should also include related disclosures about the attestation service provider. We see this as ""limited"" assurance of the ESG information being disclosed, which is less strict than a financial audit, but still requires working with a sustainability reporting partner organisation. What stage is the proposal at? The SEC’s initial proposal is currently open to a public comment period until June 10th, 2022 and will then review those comments and incorporate them into the final draft. If adopted, the rules will then go through a phase-in period that would require disclosures in filings made as early as 2024 for information in the 2023 fiscal year. The expectation is that the rule will pass in 2022, and be applied for 2023 (and beyond) reporting years. Once the proposed SEC ruling is finalised, when would we need to comply by? The proposed SEC rules include preliminary dates for compliance between 2023 and 2025, dependent on reporting company size. For size definitions and associated compliance, timeframes see the chart below from the SEC’s fact sheet that summarises the proposed timeline. Should we wait to disclose emissions and/or targets until the SEC ruling is finalised? We do not recommend delaying the measurement and disclosure of emissions or emissions targets as the proposed SEC rules are closely aligned to current best practices.Alignment is a goal of the SEC to reduce the cost of compliance, and this is unlikely to change in the final rules. Greenstone’s suite of sustainability, supply chain and investor ESG software solutions provide an integrated approach to addressing the challenge of both climate risk as well as Scope 1,2 and 3 emissions calculation and reporting. Greenstone’s Frameworks module,\xa0part of its Enterprise sustainability reporting software, has\xa0a TCFD tool to enable users to monitor Management Information and collect, analyse and report site-level climate change risks and opportunities. This will likely be aligned with the new SEC reporting requirements.

88,14/07/2022,32,20,"In February 2022, the European Commission\xa0issued its proposal for a Directive on Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence (CSDD),\xa0aiming to encourage ethical and sustainable business practices throughout all global value chains. These new regulations will provide companies with legal security and increase transparency for investors and consumers. This mandate was introduced concurrently with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which will soon replace the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD). This Proposed Directive aims to enhance the CSRD's emphasis on disclosure obligations (and associated accountability measures) by demanding changes to national corporation laws. The European Parliament and Council will be asked to approve the plan. After the Directive is enacted, Member States have two years to incorporate it into domestic legislation and provide the pertinent texts to the Commission. EU companies: Group 1: all EU limited liability companies of substantial size and economic power (with 500+ employees and EUR 150 million+ in net turnover worldwide). Group 2: Other limited liability companies operating in defined high-impact sectors, which do not meet both Group 1 thresholds, but have more than 250 employees and a net turnover of EUR 40 million worldwide and more. For these companies, rules will start to apply 2 years later than for group 1. Non-EU companies: active in the EU with turnover threshold aligned with Group 1 and 2, generated in the EU. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are not directly in the scope of this proposal. Integrate due diligence into policiesIdentify actual or potential adverse human rights and environmental impactsPrevent or mitigate potential impactsEnd or minimise actual impactsEstablish and maintain a complaints procedureMonitor the effectiveness of the due diligence policy and measuresPublicly communicate on due diligence As a result, international treaties that safeguard human rights will be more effectively enforced. In violation of important environmental norms, this suggestion will assist in preventing negative environmental effects. Additionally: National administrative authorities nominated by Member States would be responsible for overseeing these new standards and may impose fines in case of non-compliance.Victims will have the ability to pursue legal action for damages that may have been averted with sufficient due diligence efforts.Group 1 enterprises need to have a plan to guarantee that their business strategy is consistent with reducing global warming to 1.5 °C in line with the Paris Agreement.Directors of companies must be active if due diligence is to become an integral part of how they operate as a whole. This proposal creates corporate sustainability due diligence commitment to report detrimental effects on human rights and the environment. The CSDD’s ultimate form and implementation date are both unknown. However, it is known that businesses will eventually need to adopt environmental and human rights due diligence into every entity in their organisation, and their supply chain, as well as showcase their actions to their stakeholders. It goes without saying that implementing sustainable due diligence will take time. The proposed EU directive, however, demonstrates where to begin. Additionally, you will benefit from having more control over your value chain risks once compliance due diligence efforts are in place. Greenstone enables you to engage your suppliers through its supply chain sustainability software, SupplierPortal, providing your business with transparency and compliance across your entire supplier network. Greenstone works with its clients to build long-term supplier management processes that address and reduce risk, both now and in the future. We recognise that clients are on a journey and therefore the requirements change over time, particularly as a result of external factors such as regulation.

89,06/07/2022,64,37,"Calculating the GHG or carbon emissions of an organisation is a key KPI for businesses to communicate their impact on the environment to stakeholders. Commonly grouped into scopes, reporting on GHG impacts in different categories provides transparency on where the impacts have occurred within a business’s operations. Calculating GHG emissions from investments (Scope 3, Category 15) can be daunting for private capital investors. In this article, we focus on this challenging category and outline four key things to consider when launching a program to accurately calculate GHG emissions across your entire portfolio. The\xa0GHG Protocol\xa0classifies a company's GHG emissions into three categories or 'scopes', to unify reporting and accounting of emissions worldwide. Scope 1 emissions: Covers all direct emissions from owned or controlled sources, such as energy consumption, fuels, vehicles, etc.Scope 2 emissions: Covers indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating or cooling energy consumed by the company.Scope 3 emissions: Covers all indirect emissions that occur in the value chain of the reporting company, meaning that the emissions are out of the company’s operational control, including both upstream and downstream emissions. As scope 3 emissions are the result of activities from assets not owned by the company, one company’s scope 3 emissions may originate from another company’s scope 1, Scope 2 or even scope 3 emissions. Scope 3 emissions are split between 15 categories including Category 15: Investments. In order to calculate the emissions from Scope 3, Category 15 (Investments), there are two overarching methodologies: Investment-specific method: This method involves collecting scope 1 and 2 emissions (and scope 3 when “significant”) from the investee company and allocating the emissions based upon the share of investment. Average-data method: This method uses revenue data combined with “EEIO” (environmentally extended input-out) data to estimate the scope 1 and scope 2 emissions from the investee company and allocate emissions based upon a share of investment. Many organisations will use the EEIO model as a first step. To do this, they will take the revenue of the investee company and multiply it by the appropriate EEIO emission factor that is representative of the investee company’s industry sector. They will then use its proportional share of equity to allocate the estimated scope 1 and scope 2 emissions of the investee company. However, EEIO has known limitations, notably: It is not possible to differentiate between investments within a particular sector outside of financial metrics.Year-on-year changes and improvements in a specific company’s operational GHG footprint are not captured.The data is based on averages, rather than accurate primary data.   Tackling the investment-specific approach can seem daunting for an investor. Here, we outline four considerations when launching a program to tackle the investment-specific method of data collection for private investors: Define an engagement program, not a project Firstly, it is essential to look at the investment-specific method of calculating GHG emissions as a program, rather than a project. This will embed a long-term approach to how data is collected, can be improved over time and create buy-in for environmental improvements and target setting. Key steps in launching an investment-specific GHG data collection program across a portfolio: 2. Communicate expectations and the journey to portfolio companies As with any data request, it is essential to communicate what is required clearly but also expand on the when, how and why. Portfolio companies will look to investors for guidance on what is needed today but also understand what the journey will look like. For many privately held companies, they may not historically have been required to report on environmental or carbon data and as such, an educational element to communication is key. Some examples of what to communicate when asking for GHG data: Scope definitionsTypes of GHG emissions dataUnderlying data requirement (e.g. units, type and amount of fuel)How to estimate if you’re asking them to do soNotes, assumptions and coverage informationWhether a data source is required or desiredHow to submit the information (software / offline)   3. Provide a tailored approach but consistent tools Portfolio companies will be at different stages of their GHG journeys so it is important to tailor content for different audiences based on the maturity of their reporting. Complementing the data request with relevant resources such as educational webinars, user guides, training videos, hotlines and drop-in Q&amp;A sessions will also underpin a program structure. Understanding different levels of reporting maturity in portfolio companies For portfolio companies who have never calculated their footprint before and are just starting the process, providing simple, step-by-step and easy-to-use tools will ensure they are supported in the right way. With the use of the right tools and guidance, these companies can calculate their own GHG footprint accurately without having to engage with consultants on lengthy and costly projects.There will also be immature but ambitious portfolio companies, that want to calculate and report ESG and emissions data at a granular level and set targets. Providing this group of companies with the right enterprise-level tools to enable them to not just report, but also manage and mitigate GHG emissions will ensure that a management and mitigation agenda can be embedded from the outset.The mature reporter portfolio companies will most likely already be reporting their GHG emissions as part of their ESG reporting strategy. For this group, it’s important that you have the right mechanism in place to capture data from them in a way that eliminates duplication (but ensures consistency).   4. Document assumptions, estimations and approach It is important to define a methodology for majority and minority portfolio companies and how a bottom-up approach to data collection might need to be tailored (or completed by EEIO) to complete the reporting picture. A common question is when and how Scope 3 data should be included in an investment-specific calculation. For portfolio companies in certain sectors (e.g. manufacturing and retail) this could be a large task and a Scope 3 reporting journey for the portfolio company. The\xa0GHG Protocol Scope 3 Standard\xa0states that it “does not set a threshold above which scope 3 emissions should be included; instead, reporting companies should develop their own significance threshold based on their business goals.” EEIO data can be used to estimate the relative size of Scope 3 emissions compared to Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions for sectors to help determine where investment-specific approaches are needed. This will ensure that portfolio company data requests are (a) targeted and (b) value-driven. Other considerations such as ownership data, apportioning ownership data from investment and divestment dates and estimating minority portfolio company data are key to ensuring that a portfolio footprint is as comprehensive as possible. Finally, in addition to common intensity metrics (e.g. full-time employees, revenue), a diverse portfolio may benefit from industry-specific groupings to sub-analyse some intensity level trends within a portfolio. For example, if you have several portfolio companies in the retail space, floor area could be a useful normalisation metric to compare and aggregate Scope 1 + 2 emissions by square foot as a KPI. In conclusion, it is important to approach investment-specific GHG reporting (or bottom-up GHG reporting) as a program that will set portfolio companies as stewards for responsible ESG.

90,30/06/2022,42,17,"The world of ESG and Sustainability reporting changes rapidly. As the reporting sphere evolves, more and more ‘hot’ topics appear that require companies to shift their focus. On the half way point of 2022, our team of industry experts has highlighted five Sustainability, ESG and supply chain topics that are more than trends. If you haven’t yet started incorporating these in your reporting, now is the time to do so.   There is no doubt that the developments in ESG over the past couple of years have set the stage for a significant ramp-up in ESG initiatives, investments and financing in 2022. Today’s investors understand ESG investing benefits and expect ESG reporting. The quality and quantity of ESG data will continue to improve as reporting requirements and expectations grow. The continuing growth of responsible investing is leading companies to address material ESG issues they may have overlooked or not considered relevant previously. Responsible investors are spurring companies to address issues that impact workers, customers, communities, and the climate. This has become particularly important to investors over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, as companies with strong ESG performance showed lower instability overall.   Social issues, such as diversity and inclusion, or labour rights, will continue to come to the forefront of discussion this year. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed systemic social problems across the corporate world, particularly around how companies treat their workforces. In the past, these social issues tended to lag behind environmental aspects, as they are harder to define and measure. We are likely to see an increase in investors seeking to minimise the risk that societal factors pose to long-term investments. As with ESG investing as a whole, showing a preference for companies that pay attention to these social issues can be a way for investors to reflect their values in investing, while also leading to higher and more reliable returns over the long term.   Net-zero has rapidly moved into the mainstream over the past year. According to\xa0the Science-based Target Initiative (SBTi)\xa0in 2019, net-zero pledges covered just 16% of the global economy; by 2021, nearly 70% had committed to net-zero by 2050. More than 600 companies worldwide have already committed to reaching science-based net-zero before 2050 through the SBTi’s Business Ambition for 1.5°C campaign. The SBTi began validating net-zero targets from January 2022. Carbon offsetting – the compensation for carbon emissions through projects that are reducing carbon emissions elsewhere - will also continue to come into the forefront in 2022. Although the primary focus for companies should remain on rapid reductions in actual carbon emissions, offsetting is increasingly seen as a key part of the overall net-zero agenda. With the majority of corporate climate targets now stretching up to 30 years in the future, many companies are not waiting for the end point and instead are neutralising residual emissions as they progress through the purchasing of credible offsets.   As more and more organisations set ambitious reduction targets, it is becoming increasingly essential that they are able to measure and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with their value chain. Scope 3 emissions, also known as value chain emissions, are indirect GHG emissions both upstream and downstream of an organisation’s main operations. This usually means all of the emissions a company is responsible for outside of its own operations—from the goods it purchases to the disposal of the products it sells. We saw a surge in companies assessing their scope 3 emissions and this seems to be ongoing. It is often the case that scope 3 emissions are by far the largest proportion of an organisation’s carbon footprint. However, they are also the area over which businesses have the least control and have the most difficulty quantifying. As best practices, knowledge and processes continue to develop, we will see a huge increase in the coverage and accuracy of scope 3 data.   Over the last few years, COVID-19 and the social justice movement have been stark reminders about the importance of diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&amp;I) in all aspects of our society. The business world is no exception. Expectations placed on companies, and investor and consumer interest in DE&amp;I, have notably increased and will continue to do so for the rest of 2022. DE&amp;I commonly falls under the ‘Social’ pillar of ESG. Investors, business partners and consumers are now demanding transparency into organisations’ diversity programmes, metrics and key performance indicators. Diversity goes beyond an organisation’s operational impact. Diversity within supply chains can make supply chains more resilient and adaptable which is particularly critical now as businesses and industries have been forced to pivot during the pandemic. As more companies look to engage with diverse suppliers, understanding who they are and the key data points for reporting on supplier DE&amp;I has become more important.   In conclusion, what does this all mean for ESG-focused investors and companies? For both groups, requirements to understand, assess and measure the ESG aspects of operations, investments and portfolios will grow, as will the need to expand their data collection, management and reporting functions. As the investor and business sustainability landscape grows in complexity, companies begin to deliver on net-zero pledges and ESG transparency improves, 2022 could still be the strongest year yet in terms of the acceleration of ESG into the mainstream.",unstructured
91,22/06/2022,41,28,"In March 2022, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) released\xa0a new proposal\xa0for public companies to begin reporting their carbon emissions and reductions progress alongside their financial results. These SEC rules aim to make corporate sustainability reporting more common, consistent, and standardised like financial accounting and reporting, similar to the recent\xa0EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)\xa0in Europe.\xa0At Greenstone, we are keeping a close eye on the progress of the proposal and have put together a series of resources on what to look out for ahead of the final vote. This blog covers who this proposal applies to, what it asks for, what the requirements for scope 3 are and how Greenstone’s software can help start preparations. Who is affected by the proposal? We expect the SEC's rules will apply to all publicly-listed\xa0companies with an existing SEC reporting requirement. The initial focus will be on what the SEC defines as large accelerated filers, which are publicly traded companies with a market cap above $700 million. The SEC also mentions smaller registrants in its proposal. Under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, the SEC's proposed climate disclosure requirements may also end up applying to a broader group of registrants, including: Any company with total assets in excess of $10 million and 500 or more record holders of a class of equity security, each measured at the end of its fiscal yearOther SEC registrants For large companies, the SEC's climate disclosure requirements begin in 2023. Smaller companies have until 2025 before they need to comply. What is the proposal asking for? Largely due to investors' requests, the SEC is requiring companies to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and climate risks in a standardised way. The main disclosure topics include: Climate-related risks (including risk identification/impact governance, oversight/risk management and mitigation)Greenhouse gas emissionsClimate-related financial metrics Much of the SEC’s proposal builds on the work of the\xa0Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which already requires disclosures to ensure investors have full insight into the carbon and climate risks in their portfolios. With this proposal, companies would need to submit the following alongside their financial disclosures in their annual reports: Disclosure of Scope 1 &amp; 2 GHG emissions (i.e., direct emissions and those from purchasing electricity and heating/cooling) and calculation methodology.Disclosure of Scope 3 GHG emissions and calculation methodology, if material to the reporting company, or if the reporting company has set a public Scope 3 emissions target. Scope 3 is covered in the section below.Disclosure of both absolute emissions\xa0and\xa0emissions intensity factors across all relevant scopes. Emissions intensity can be defined as either emissions per unit of annual revenue\xa0or emissions per unit of production for the fiscal year, (i.e., dividing total emissions by a fixed business metric e.g. revenue).Alignment of emissions measurement with the standards and guidance established by the\xa0GHG Protocol.Alignment of emissions inventory with the reporting company’s fiscal year, and, if data is reasonably available, emissions should be reported for the same number of years as required for the income statement and cash flow statement.Third-party assurance of Scope 1 &amp; 2 emissions (dependent on reporting company size)Disclosure of all public climate pledges or emissions targets, including:Target emissions boundary and time horizonHow the reporting company intends to meet its targetsData to indicate whether the reporting company is making progress toward its targetHow progress has been achievedDisclosure related to the use of carbon offsets and/or renewable energy certificates, including quantity, type, certification, and other relevant characteristics. Emissions figures would also have to list any carbon credits separately so that investors can see total emissions in isolation. Any\xa0internal carbon price\xa0used and the logic used to calculate it.The compliance deadline would be between 2023 and 2025 depending on the size of the organisation (the table in the FAQ provides the timeframe) What about Scope 3? Companies will be required to include Scope 3 data if those emissions are deemed by investors to be “material”. While there’s no official guidance there yet, it’s expected that the largest filers will be covered. While smaller companies may not have a\xa0direct\xa0requirement to report Scope 3 emissions, the SEC’s proposal includes a rule that states that if a company has a public emissions-reduction goal, you must disclose your plan and progress against that specific goal. If your public goal includes Scope 3 emissions, you must include Scope 3 progress in your SEC reports. Greenstone’s suite of sustainability, supply chain and investor ESG software solutions provide an integrated approach to addressing the challenge of both climate risk as well as Scope 1,2 and 3 emissions calculation and reporting. Greenstone’s Frameworks module,\xa0part of its Enterprise sustainability reporting software, has\xa0a TCFD tool to enable users to monitor Management Information and collect, analyse and report site-level climate change risks and opportunities.

92,15/06/2022,59,26,"At the unprecedented rate at which climate change is happening, more and more companies are starting to act with urgency. CDP disclosure is driving corporate transparency and helping to guide, incentivise and assess climate action. In 2021, a record-breaking\xa013,000+ companies representing over 64% of global market capitalization disclosed through CDP\xa0– 35% more than 2020, and over 141% more than when the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015. Whether you are new to CDP reporting or you are looking for ways to improve your previous year’s score, our team of sustainability experts has compiled a list of four essential tips, to help you optimise your 2022 CDP score. We’ve also included answers your top most frequently asked questions regarding CDP. 1. Answer the question being asked While it may be tempting to just include a copy of your company's climate change strategy, it may not receive all the points it deserves.\xa0This is because CDP has a very specific scoring system. Fortunately, they issue a comprehensive scoring guide which can be downloaded from the CDP website.\xa0By including keywords and structuring your answers in the specified way, your company can receive maximum marks for its climate change strategy and actions.\xa0You call also attach additional files such as your organisations sustainability policy, so that readers of your response gain a better view of your company’s overall position on these issues. 2. Research similar organisations Collaboration is more than a buzz word in sustainability, it is an essential part of it. CDP recognises this by publishing its ‘Global 500 Climate change Leaders’ list, highlighting companies across each industry sector which receive the highest score for both disclosure and performance. So whether you're a pharmaceutical company or a banking institution you can research what is being done to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in your industry, as many of these leading organisations now publicly publish their CDP submission.\xa0Not only does investigating these industry leaders provide you with tips on how to improve your score, they can also provide the inspiration and best practice guidelines to further develop your organisation's climate change strategy. 3. Don't be afraid to ask for help The sheer volume of the CDP questionnaire can sometimes make the process seem overwhelming. For this reason many organisations seek external help, whether it's to help them frame responses in the best way possible or audit their emissions to ensure that everything is up to an appropriate standard. 4. It's okay to submit a work in progress Organisations often believe they need to have perfect answer before they can make a submission. However it is important to remember that many of the participating companies are still developing their climate change strategies.\xa0By demonstrating that you're engaging with the process you can help bolster your company’s reputation in sustainability.\xa0Even if you don't have an answer for a specific section of the questionnaire, it is important not to leave it blank.\xa0For example if your company doesn't currently integrate climate change risks into its business strategy then state this and explain how you plan to address the issue in the future.     CDP’s climate change questionnaire is aligned with TCFD recommendations and now contains over 25 TCFD-aligned questions. These questions are within the Governance, Risks &amp; Opportunities, Strategy, Targets and Emissions modules. CDP's water security and deforestation questionnaires, inspired by the TCFD recommendations and organised in a similar structure, are also now covering topics such as Governance, Strategy, Metrics and Targets. Continue reading about the CDP &amp; TCFD alignment here. What are the disclosure options for first-time CDP responders? If this is your first year responding to a CDP questionnaire, there are a couple of different disclosure options available to you: You can respond to the full version of the questionnaire by the scoring deadline (27th July 2022) and opt for a private score. This score will only be made available to you and to CDP and will be kept private from requesting investors. This is the route CDP would always recommend companies take in their first year so companies get a sense of what it is like to respond but also to sense check their performance before officially submitting to investors or purchasing companies.You can respond to the minimum version of the questionnaire. The minimum version contains fewer questions than the full version and does not have any sector-specific questions, and won't be scored. You have until the 28th of September to submit this response.You can submit either version of the questionnaire by the 28th of September. This response won't be scored, but your data will still be shared with CDP’s investor signatories and any other requests.Alternatively, first-time responders can submit the full questionnaire by the scoring deadline and receive a public score. Learn more about the CDP reporting timeline, disclosure options for first-time responders and what’s changed in 2022 here. I am a company with an approved Scope 3 SBT. Do I need to report this target in my CDP disclosure? Yes – to fulfil the reporting criterion for SBTi-approved targets through CDP disclosure, companies\xa0should report all approved SBTs in their CDP disclosures. The SBTi validation service does not\xa0currently classify the ambition of Scope 3 targets, so in most cases, companies should select “Other,\xa0please specify” in the Target ambition field. However, if your company is a member of the Business\xa0Ambition for the 1.5°C campaign and has selected Option 1, its commitment includes setting 1.5°C-aligned Scope 3 targets. The campaign currently considers Scope 3 targets to be 1.5°C-aligned\xa0when the targets result in a linear annual reduction of at least 4.2% over the target timeframe.\xa0In these cases, companies should select “1.5°C aligned” in the Target ambition field for the relevant target(s).

93,08/06/2022,24,15,"The revised Universal Standards - the global benchmarks for sustainability reporting that enable organisations to understand and report on their impacts represent the most significant update since the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) transitioned from providing guidance to setting standards in 2016. The GRI standards are a modular system and consist of three series of standards; revised Universal Standards, new Sector Standards, adapted Topic Standards. This article aims to provide a better understanding of what these standards mean for business as well as highlight the main updates that took place. The Universal Standards apply to all organisations and include foundation, general disclosures and material topics that will help organisations report in accordance with the GRI standards. The standards are developed following a transparent and multi-stakeholder process overseen by the Global Sustainability Standards Board (GSSB). These standards have been revised to align with intergovernmental organisations and authoritative instruments as set by the UN and OECD and is the first reporting standard to fully reflect due diligence expectations for organisations to manage their sustainability impacts. The standards will come into effect on January 1st\xa02023, however, companies are encouraged to transition earlier where possible. Outlines the purpose of the GRI standards, clarifying key concepts and explaining how to interpret the standards in totality. GRI 1 states the reporting principles to enable better quality and presentation of data and stresses on reporting in accordance with the GRI standards, thereby replacing the 'Core' and 'Comprehensive' options that previously existed. It also focuses on some of the key concepts including the impacts of organisations on the economic environment and people, including on human rights as well as due diligence and stakeholders. Contains revised disclosures for organisations to provide information on their reporting practises, governance, strategy, policies and stakeholder engagement. The technical committee specifically worked on GRI 2 providing their input on new disclosures in policy commitments for responsible business conduct including human rights and due diligence. Comprises of a revised approach to materiality by incorporating the concept of due diligence with improved guidance on how to determine material topics. GRI 3 also contains revised disclosures for reporting the process of determining as well as managing the list of material topics identified. Key additions to the set of standards that aim to provide information on a sector’s most significant impacts. The sector standards are not a substitute for an organisation’s own materiality process, instead, they are to be used as additional and complementary resources.

94,25/05/2022,33,20,"As more and more organisations set ambitious reduction targets, it is becoming increasingly essential that they are able to measure and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with their value chain. This article aims to help businesses understand the challenges of scope 3 emissions, where to start in tackling scope 3 reporting and how software solutions are being used to solve the challenges of calculation, reduction and reporting. Scope 3 emissions, also known as value chain emissions, are indirect GHG emissions both upstream and downstream of an organisation’s main operations. This usually means all of the emissions a company is responsible for outside of its own operations—from the goods it purchases to the disposal of the products it sells. It is often the case that scope 3 emissions are by far the largest proportion of an organisations’ carbon footprint. However, they are also the area over which businesses have the least control and have the most difficulty quantifying. Under the\xa0Greenhouse Gas Protocol guidance, these emissions are split into 15 categories. This is done to help businesses identify which activities are relevant to them, break down how they might more easily collect the data and inform the reporting and management of calculated emissions. With time running out to make the drastic global emissions cuts required under the Paris Agreement, scope 3 offers an opportunity to drive rapid environmental engagement through supply chains, global and local businesses, local and national governments and consumers. Whilst reducing the emissions associated with your own organisation’s operational or equity boundary ensures that your own sustainability performance improves, tackling scope 3 requires engaging with many other businesses and stakeholders throughout the value chain. There are numerous reasons beyond the urgent need for rapid global decarbonisation that are driving organisations towards more accurate scope 3 emissions disclosure. Two of the key drivers are Science-Based Targets and Net-Zero pathways. By the end of 2020 over 1000 companies across over 60 countries had committed to setting a science-based target. These targets align your organisation’s reduction targets with the latest climate science for limiting warming to 1.5 degrees or well below 2 degrees. Should your scope 3 emissions account for more than 40% of your overall emissions, then the SBTi requires you to set a target to cover this impact. Net-zero goals demand similarly long term and well-defined emission reduction pathways. In order to be able to achieve net-zero goals, organisations need to not only disclose and understand their scope 3 emissions, but they also need an accurate approach that enables them to actually reduce these emissions. For example, estimated scope 3 emissions based on spend datasets (such as invoices or bills) mean that the only way to reduce the emissions is through a reduction in spending. In addition to the need to set and track against long term emission reduction targets aligned with science, there are also growing demands from multiple stakeholders for organisations to report on scope 3 emissions. Indeed, most sustainability reporting frameworks and ratings now all include scope 3 criteria.  Scope 3 emissions are typically outside the direct control of an organisation and therefore accessing data and accurately calculating the associated emissions is a significant challenge. In addition, the value chain itself is likely to be global and extremely complex, further exacerbating the difficulty in communicating with the relevant stakeholders effectively, let alone collecting accurate data to calculate carbon emissions. Communication, collaboration and shared goals are key to achieving successful scope 3 disclosure. However, even if you have a high level of buy-in both up and down the value chain there are still complexities around the data itself and the methodologies used to calculate emissions. For example, understanding the proportion of emissions from a supplier that relate to the goods or services that you purchase, or balancing the need between acceptable assumptions and the need for accurate primary data. Through its award-winning software solutions and client support team of reporting experts, Greenstone enables its clients to accurately calculate and report on all scope 3 categories. Greenstone’s suite of sustainability, ESG and supply chain software solutions provide integrated GHG emissions calculations in accordance with the GHG Protocol.

95,18/05/2022,46,29,"Over the last few years, COVID-19 and the social justice movement have been stark reminders of the importance of diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&amp;I) in all aspects of our society. The business world is no exception. Expectations placed on companies have increased and investor and consumer interest in environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors, including DE&amp;I, have notably increased. Investors, customers and employees are also becoming more aware of companies' social responsibilities. They expect that businesses engender positive impacts in relation to DE&amp;I through their policies, processes and behaviours, both within the organisation and throughout including their supply chains. In a\xa0recent survey of supply chain organisations, by Gartner and the Association for Supply Chain Management (ASCM), the following trends emerged in relation to engagement with DE&amp;I issues and where businesses are currently focussing their efforts: 62% of supply chain organizations are looking at the dimensions of ethnicity/race as part of their recruitment strategy.30% of the full-time supply chain workforce are people of colour, but only 9% of supply chain VPs are people of colour.41% — about 3 of every 7 — of supply chain organizations have no plans to improve DEI.Most DEI initiatives in place at supply chain organizations prioritize education and awareness-raising (30%), followed by recruiting (20%) and integrated pipeline planning (20%). In this blog, Greenstone discusses the importance of diversity within supply chains and the benefits of implementing a supplier diversity programme. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, or DE&amp;I as it is commonly referred to, is a term that broadly outlines the efforts an institution takes to create a more welcoming environment for people or companies that are less privileged. The\xa0Independent Sector\xa0defines DE&amp;I in the following way: Diversity includes all the ways in which people differ, encompassing the different characteristics that make one individual or group different from another. While diversity is often used in reference to race, ethnicity, and gender, we embrace a broader definition of diversity that also includes age, national origin, religion, disability, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, education, marital status, language, and physical appearance. Equity is the fair treatment, access, opportunity, and advancement for all people, while at the same time striving to identify and eliminate barriers that have prevented the full participation of some groups. Improving equity involves increasing justice and fairness within the procedures and processes of institutions or systems, as well as in their distribution of resources. Tackling equity issues requires an understanding of the root causes of outcome disparities within our society. Inclusion is the act of creating environments in which any individual or group can be and feel welcomed, respected, supported, and valued to fully participate. An inclusive and welcoming climate embraces differences and offers respect in words and actions for all people. As our population becomes more diverse, companies that don’t invest in DE&amp;I in their workforce and supplier base can find themselves getting left behind. Businesses that prioritise DE&amp;I are well-positioned to have a greater positive impact on their employees, customers, suppliers and the communities where they live and work. DE&amp;I commonly falls under the ‘Social’ pillar of ESG and there has been a significant increase in attention to this area from investors who are now incorporating ESG considerations within their investment processes. Investors, business partners and consumers are now demanding transparency into organisations’ diversity programmes, metrics and key performance indicators. Diversity goes beyond an organisation’s operational impact. Diversity within supply chains can make supply chains more resilient and adaptable which is particularly critical now as businesses and industries have been forced to pivot during the pandemic. As more companies look to engage with diverse suppliers, understanding who they are and the key data points for reporting on supplier DE&amp;I has become more important. A diverse supplier is commonly categorised as a business that is at least 51% owned and operated by an individual or group that is part of a traditionally underrepresented or underserved group. Common examples are small-business enterprises (SBEs), minority-owned business enterprises (MBEs), and woman-owned business enterprises (WBEs). According to the\xa02019 US Census Bureau Annual Business Survey (ABS), approximately 18.3% (1.0 million) of all U.S. businesses were minority-owned and about 19.9% (1.1 million) of all businesses were owned by women. Some major companies have long played a role in addressing inequality through supplier diversity programmes that promote an inclusive approach to procurement. One example of this is\xa0UPS\xa0whose supplier diversity programme, which started in 1992, grew out of its desire to be more inclusive and do what is right. The company now spends $2.6 billion annually doing business with around 6,000 small and diverse suppliers with a goal to increase that spending amount year over year. Under the\xa0Small Business Subcontracting Program (FAR 19.7)), the U.S. federal government also requires any contractor whose contract for goods and services is expected to exceed $700,000 ($1.5 million for construction) to set and meet aggressive goals of subcontracting spending with diverse suppliers. With many global business leaders waking up to the huge importance of supplier diversity, businesses that understand how to use this to their advantage will stand to gain a competitive advantage and make tangible positive contributions to a fairer society by working with diverse companies. As well as helping diverse suppliers to grow, implementing a supplier diversity programme can provide opportunities for buyers including: Promote innovation through the introduction of new products, services, and solutionsProvide multiple channels from which to procure goods and servicesDrive competition (on price and service levels) between the company’s existing and potential vendorsEnable a company to take advantage of new opportunities for business expansion with the emergence of new consumer needsHelp to attract new talent when recruiting for a company In a\xa02019 study for Coca-Cola, it was found that the individuals who were aware of Coca-Cola’s supplier diversity initiatives were 45% more likely to perceive the brand as valuing diversity, 25% were more likely to think favourably about the brand, and 49% were more likely to use Coca-Cola products. Greenstone’s sustainable supply chain software, SupplierPortal, supports our clients' DE&amp;I and supplier diversity programmes through the gathering and assessment of relevant metrics across a global supplier network. SupplierPortal, as a sustainable supply chain software, provides standard DE&amp;I assessment capability and is also fully customisable, meaning bespoke assessments can be distributed across different supplier groups or categories. The easy-to-use analysis tools enable companies to track DE&amp;I performance across different suppliers as well as report on the diversity of the supply chain as a whole.",unstructured
96,11/05/2022,62,40,"With the latest IPCC report, last year’s COP26 conference and almost constant news reports on the subject, climate change and the reduction of carbon now seem to be at the centre of most discussions. As our attention is turned towards the ways businesses can act now to limit warming to 1.5°C, some terms used can lead to confusion. This article discusses the difference between terms such as ‘GHG’ and ‘carbon’ emissions and their connection to climate change. We will also touch on the impact that COVID-19 has had on emissions and how the right sustainability reporting software can help organisations track and report on their climate targets. Carbon emissions The terms ‘GHG emissions’ and ‘carbon emissions’ are used interchangeably in everyday conversation.\xa0Carbon emissions have become the shorthand for carbon dioxide (CO2)\xa0emissions\xa0and/or carbon dioxide equivalent. CO2\xa0is an important heat-trapping (greenhouse) gas, which is released through human activities such as deforestation and burning fossil fuels, as well as natural processes such as respiration and volcanic eruptions. It consists of one part carbon and two parts oxygen and is one of the most important gases on the earth because plants use it to produce carbohydrates in a process called photosynthesis. GHG emissions  Greenhouse gases (GHGs) are gases in the atmosphere that absorb and emit radiant energy, causing the ‘greenhouse effect’. They let sunlight pass through the atmosphere, but they prevent the heat that the sunlight brings from leaving the atmosphere. The main greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol are: Water vapourCarbon dioxideMethaneNitrous oxideFluorinated gases Human activities (including the consumption of energy and burning fuel in buildings and transportation) have increased the amount of these gases in the atmosphere, which in turn has increased the rate of natural global warming and caused adverse climate change. The main greenhouse gases emitted by companies are carbon dioxide (CO?), methane (CH?) and nitrous oxide (N?O). These gases are usually expressed as a “carbon footprint” in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO?e).\xa0Given that a single activity can cause multiple greenhouse gases to be emitted, each in different quantities, a carbon footprint if written out in full could get confusing. So carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) is a standard unit for counting greenhouse gas emissions regardless of whether they’re from carbon dioxide or another gas, such as methane. What’s included in a GHG footprint? The\xa0GHG Protocol\xa0classifies a company\'s GHG emissions into three categories or ""scopes"", to unify reporting and accounting of emissions worldwide. Scope 1 emissions:\xa0Covers all direct emissions from owned or controlled sources, such as energy consumption, fuels, vehicles, etc. Scope 2 emissions:\xa0Covers indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating or cooling energy consumed by the company. Scope 3 emissions:\xa0Covers all indirect emissions that occur in the value chain of the reporting company. Scope 3 emissions are split between 15 categories, including both upstream and downstream emissions. As scope 3 emissions are the result of activities from assets not owned by the company, one company’s scope 3 emissions may originate from another company’s own scope 1, Scope 2 or even scope 3 emissions. Relation to Climate change Variations in gases such as carbon dioxide (CO?) occur naturally in the atmosphere. However, current levels have reached a new limit. Based on a recent IPCC \xa0climate report,\xa0human activities are estimated to have caused approximately 1.0°C of global warming above pre-industrial levels. Global warming is likely to reach or exceed 1.5°C between 2030 and 2052 if it continues to increase at the current rate. This means that the emissions trajectory required to avoid crossing the 1.5°C threshold mandates a significant reduction by 2030. The\xa0NDC Synthesis report\xa0indicates that while there is a clear trend that greenhouse gas emissions are being reduced over time, when taking all 191 Parties of the Paris Agreement into account, global GHG emissions in 2030 are expected to be 16% higher compared to 2010. COVID-19 impact As social and economic activity came to a standstill throughout the world in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, GHG emissions plummeted. According to\xa0IEA, Global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions rose by 6% in 2021 to 36.3 billion tonnes, their highest ever level, as the world economy rebounded strongly from the COVID-19 crisis and relied heavily on coal to power that growth.  The latest IEA analysis, published in March 2022, stated that the COVID-19 pandemic had far-reaching impacts on energy demand in 2020, reducing global CO2 emissions by 5.2%. However, the world has experienced an extremely rapid economic recovery since then, driven by unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus and a fast – although uneven – the roll-out of vaccines.  Emissions increased by almost 2.1 Gt from 2020 levels. This puts 2021 above 2010 as the largest ever year-on-year increase in energy-related CO2 emissions in absolute terms. The 6% increase in CO2 emissions in 2021 was in line with the jump in global economic output of 5.9%. How companies can help to limit global warming Companies can lead the way to a zero-carbon economy, boost innovation and drive sustainable growth by setting ambitious, science-based emissions reduction targets.  Science-based targets provide companies with a clearly-defined path to reduce emissions in line with the Paris Agreement goals. More than 2,000 businesses around the world are already working with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) Business Ambition for 1.5°C is an urgent call to action from a global coalition of UN agencies, business and industry leaders, in partnership with the Race to Zero.  The SBTi has launched the world’s first framework for corporate net-zero target setting in line with climate science, The Net-Zero Standard. By signing up to the Net-Zero Standard and committing to set a target in line with a 1.5C and net-zero future a company can make its critical contribution to limiting the worst impacts of climate breakdown. Greenstone &amp; GHG emissions - how Greenstone can help with targets Through its sustainability reporting software and supporting services, Greenstone enables its clients to accurately measure and report GHG emissions across their organisation, supply chain and investments. Greenstone’s suite of ESG, supply chain and sustainability reporting software solutions provides integrated GHG emissions calculations using 1m+ emissions factors from international standards including GHG Protocol, Defra, US EPA and IEA.

Emission targets can be set for general emissions or for a specific data source. Greenstone’s sustainability reporting software includes an enhanced Targets functionality in the Environment module.\xa0Science-based targets, net-zero targets and consumption and emissions targets can be tracked and monitored over time using Greenstone’s targets dashboards.",unstructured
97,04/05/2022,38,16,"Across the asset-management world, interest in Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance has soared since the launch of the\xa0UNPRI (Principles for Responsible Investments)\xa0in 2006. Integrating ESG factors into investment decisions and portfolio management strategies is increasingly becoming the norm and investors are seeking to better understand a company’s long-term value by looking at ESG information. However, this trend in responsible investment and ESG reporting is presenting investors with many challenges when it comes to gathering, maintaining and analysing ESG data. Gaining access to accurate, credible and consistent ESG data and supporting information is difficult.  ESG software is the obvious way to streamline the ESG data collection, questionnaire distribution and management process. Investors are now looking for purpose-built ESG software platforms to collect, track and analyse data and material ESG KPIs from their portfolios on an ongoing basis. Here are some of the reasons why investors are seeking ESG software to manage portfolio data: The monitoring of performance over time is essential to understand long-term risks and opportunities. To build a sustainable long-term investment strategy that will support investment decisions, investors need access to current and correct data for both now and in the future – not just a time-stamped data set.  Using a central software platform to collect and manage the ESG performance data of portfolio companies enables investors to assess performance data on an ongoing basis, rather than in one moment in time. By sending questionnaires directly to portfolio companies through a software solution, deadlines, flags and notifications can be set which means that investors can be automatically alerted when it’s time to request updated information or address an expired document. Scoring of portfolio companies also ensures that year on year improvements can be realised and minimum performance thresholds can be met.   Access to accurate and consistent ESG data to enable responsible investment decisions is now more important than ever. There is a plethora of ESG frameworks and guidelines available for ESG reporting but, for investors, working out which ESG metrics to request from companies is challenging. Before seeking data, investors need to be sure that that data will reliably support their investment decisions and accurately enable their long-term sustainability strategy. ESG software enables investors to customise questionnaires and data collection to ensure they are collecting the right data. Once collected, the software will enable them to aggregate consistent, comparable and accurate ESG performance data from across funds and portfolios. It also enables investors to compare, benchmark and score portfolio companies and view key information across various metrics and KPIs.   Many firms are still using spreadsheets and emails and, as data gets more complex, these processes become cumbersome, time-consuming and prone to error. Manual processes are not only a security risk but are also prone to risk and error and are extremely heavy on time and resources. Through the use of software, data collection, management and reporting can all be automated, on a large scale, which leaves investors more time for analysis. Using software enables investors to move their focus away from just data collection and on to in-depth reporting, analysis and informed decision-making. Investors are seeking to understand the ESG-related business risks and opportunities companies face. This includes assessing the potential impact of ESG factors on a company’s long-term business model and the resilience of companies to adapt to ESG changes. Over time, these considerations may reshape competitive advantages and ultimately the sustainability of business growth and long-term value creation for shareholders. ESG software has functionality for investors to easily identify and address ESG risk. Company responses can be benchmarked, assessed and scored against pre-defined criteria using automated analysis tools such as scorecards and performance scores can be generated. High-risk responses can then be easily identified and an action plan solution can be set. Using an ESG software platform, Investors can directly communicate with their portfolio companies, set actions with deadlines, define and track defined KPIs. Portfolio company engagement in ESG performance can be a challenge for investors and sometimes there can be little to no communication lines between the two parties. There are huge benefits to communication and engagement between asset managers and their portfolio companies. A credible software solution will enable communication between both parties and facilitate direct online conversations around very specific issues. Beyond due diligence and receiving alerts for flagged issues, a software solution enables investors to identify and engage with portfolio companies and help them to improve areas of ESG underperformance. This enables the building of more sustainable and collaborative relationships.   ESG reporting for private capital investors is complicated by both the lack of regulation and the lack of clean and effective gathering, maintenance and analysis of ESG data. In public markets, there are multiple providers of ESG data but very little correlation, and the tendency to scrape data has its own problems.",unstructured
98,28/04/2022,80,36,"One of the most publicised and immediate impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic was and still is, the impact on supply chains. Everything impacted supply chains - from the restrictions being placed on the movement of people and the ways in which goods could be transported, to the human impact of the virus that meant it became more challenging to produce goods and deliver services. These short-term impacts, or supply chain shocks, required ingenuity and resilience to resolve; to ensure that global supply chains functioned sufficiently well to support communities and commerce. This has led to very rapid changes in the way that suppliers are managed, coupled with the repurposing of existing management tools and practices to align with the new stresses and strains placed upon people, companies and interconnected supply chains. Sustainable procurement, or responsible sourcing, was increasingly coming to the fore in the years prior to the pandemic. How organisations align their purchasing practices with their overarching corporate sustainability goals is a key factor in a meaningful sustainability programme. The pandemic has shone a light on the relationship between strong sustainability performance and resilience, and it is with this in mind that we see the opportunities to ‘build back greener’ touted across large parts of the economy. It is clear that more responsible and sustainable supply chains will be key to achieving the goal of building back better. In this article, we look at what the short-term impacts of COVID-19 have been on supply chains, how we have seen supplier management practices pivot to face these challenges and what the longer-term outlook might be and what opportunities this represents. According to\xa0McKinsey, 73% of executives said they had encountered problems in their supply base as a result of COVID-19. The immediate and most obvious impact of COVID-19 on these supply chains was that of supply. There were clear increases in demand for certain products due to consumer concern about supply. This exacerbated real issues that were arising throughout the supply chain and leading to actual supply stress, resulting in a positive feedback loop that deepened the problem. Some issues that contributed to constricted supply were related to confusion and a lack of understanding of the virus itself. Meaning that cross-border flows of goods stalled due to safety precautions needing to be understood and then implemented, and local ‘lockdown’ regulations needing to be understood in relation to trade, before the flow of goods from origin could continue. The above example can clearly be applied to food supply chains. However, COVID-19 impacts extend beyond just food and have the potential to impact the supply of any type of physical good, which in turn can affect all business sectors including our clients across professional and financial services. This is borne out by the fact that\xa094% of Fortune 1000 companies are seeing coronavirus supply chain disruptions. The interconnectedness of supply chains, whilst proving a blessing in the modern world, was very quickly shown to be a weakness if they were not fully understood by the actors throughout them. Similarly, applicable across all sectors was the importance of supplier resilience. This relates to multiple aspects of a supplier’s business, ranging from financial stability and governance to the type of service or good they supply, and where that is itself created and delivered. This is why the link between good sustainability, or ESG performance, and resilience has been made. Sustainability, or ESG, covers a wide range of performance metrics across environmental, social and governance, and it appears that this has been an effective determinant of business resilience in the pandemic. Therefore, the greater the visibility of this type of indicator across your supply chain, and the more sustainable your own practices in relation to managing supplier relationships, the greater protection you have for your own operations. As already mentioned, resolving immediate supply chain shocks has required ingenuity. For example, we have seen clients placing their own employees into supplier businesses to ensure continued production at their required levels. However, it has also involved the extension and embedding of responsible supply chain practices that have been evolving over recent years. If good ESG performance can increase the resilience of your suppliers, then procurement practices that promote the selection and management of suppliers based on these principles and engender collaborative relationships with these suppliers can only reduce the risk to your own organisation. We have seen first-hand a number of changes in how companies are managing their suppliers, and how the emphasis has shifted to more sustainable approaches. The biggest enabler of the key themes that follow, is digitisation. Without the ever-increasing shift towards digital and online methods of supplier management, the coverage and currency of data required to make informed decisions would not be possible. A key focus for organisations is to carry out some form of supply chain mapping. This helps to provide transparency across the supplier base, ensuring that organisations simply understand who their suppliers are and where their goods and services are coming from. The greater the visibility that can be achieved across the tiers of the supply chain the greater the potential there is to de-risk. The aim of this enhanced visibility across the supply chain is threefold. It is to identify any vulnerabilities or risks in the supply chain, to enable appropriate supplier diversification and to improve individual and overall supplier performance. Vulnerabilities could result from single sources of supply with no viable or geographical alternatives. This vulnerability may need to be addressed with that the supplier through changed contractual terms or through on the ground collaboration to enhance resilience. However, in other instances there is a clear opportunity to implement dual-supply, whereby multiple suppliers provide the same service, providing resilience in times of stress. This is the antithesis of the trend towards lean supply chains and maximising cost savings and time efficiencies. However, in the world of digitisation, it is becoming increasingly possible to strike a balance between resilience and efficiency. The other large shift in supplier management we have seen as a result of COVID-19 is in relation to both the way in which suppliers are assessed and the way in which they are continually engaged with. The breadth of assessment has evolved from perceived business-critical requirements such as insurance documentation and information security, to become more holistic. Labour practices, sustainability programmes, environmental targets and emissions are covered in both qualification assessments and ongoing management indicators for suppliers. In some instances, suppliers are being engaged specifically on the practices they have put in place to deal with COVID-19 impacts right now, for example how they ensure continued supply from their suppliers and protect their workers. Similarly, it is important to understand how their business has prepared for the future, for example with a reduced set of products and services or a more agile approach to demand. There is also a greater focus now on continued engagement with these suppliers, and in many ways, successful engagement is the essence of a successful responsible sourcing programme. Responsive and sustainable supplier relationships are increasingly based on a collaborative approach to tackling global challenges such as climate change and slavery. COVID-19 has, however, highlighted whether organisations have the correct processes in place for engaging with suppliers quickly in order to address external shocks. Some organisations have not got to grips with managing supplier risk throughout their relationships with suppliers and instead only provide a limited form of pre-qualification assessment which provides no insight into ongoing risk. Others are much more advanced and have risk management programmes that are dynamic and ensure consistent assessments and remedial activities take place. However, even this is now viewed as limited ineffectiveness in a post-COVID world, the dial should be moved from ‘preventing bad’, to ‘doing good’. It is only through this lens that collaboration and equal partnership is brought to the fore to drive change. It seems then that COVID-19 has brought about significant changes in relation to supply chains and how they are managed, more than we can begin to speak about here. Sustainability has come to the fore and suppliers and entire supply chains need to be more resilient than ever before. However, as is often the case with seismic events, it is not so much that dramatic change has taken place, but instead, what was good has served us well and what was bad has failed us. It is with this in mind that we have the opportunity to build back better. According to\xa0McKinsey, 93% of executives plan to increase supply chain resilience. The digitalisation of supply chains will therefore further increase, with organisations who cannot be flexible and responsive left behind. We may also see more of an emphasis on security of supply rather than speed and lowest possible cost. Something that could well provide knock on benefits to the environment as consumer expectations are realigned. We will see the importance of sustainability as an indicator of resilience increase, and with supplier management processes being a key element of ‘good’ sustainability we will see more focus on procurement’s ability to deliver this. According to Gartner, 51% of supply chain professionals expect that the focus on circular economy strategies will increase over the next two years. So we can expect even more emphasis on collaborative and sustainable approaches to supplier relationships, which will facilitate organisations journeys to goals such as net-zero and zero-waste. Despite the increased equality in the buyer-supplier relationship, there will still be the need for many organisation’s to create more robust risk management procedures through continued assessment, evaluation, audit and improvement plans. In the short to medium term suppliers should expect to have to satisfy information requests from more of their customers. However, in the medium to longer term with increases in standardisation of sustainability reporting frameworks and increasingly homogenous risk databases and metrics, demonstrating resilience and good practices should become more streamlined. COVID-19 has been a global struggle. It has highlighted the need for stronger and more responsive relationships between suppliers and buyers. It has been highlighted that, with external shocks of this scale, a collaborative approach is the only way to find a resolution. There will be more external shocks in relation to resource depletion, economic downturns and climate change to name but a few. Hopefully, we will be in a position to both avoid and address these with more sustainable supply chains as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

99,21/04/2022,28,13,"On 6 April 2022, the European Commission published the long-awaited final version of the detailed rules – the Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) – under the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). These standards define the shape of the ‘level 2’ ESG disclosures required under SFDR.  Due to the length and technical detail of these standards, in late 2021 the Commission deferred implementation of the SFDR RTS to 1 January 2023. To date, firms have been required to comply with SFDR on a best efforts basis. However, now is the time for private equity managers to start adopting these metrics to enhance their ESG capabilities and stay one step ahead. What are the standards under SFDR? The RTS are a list of 31 – 14 core and 17 additional\xa0– standardised metrics of ‘principal adverse sustainability impacts.’ The required disclosures cover a broad range of key sustainability areas across Environment, Social and Governance (e.g. emissions, human rights and anti-corruption respectively). Importantly, the standards include several key definitions, as well as details on how data should be aggregated up to the portfolio level – both of which are likely to become accepted standards. With reference to other key sources within European law, the framework provides definitions for traditionally ‘grey’ areas associated with categories such as biodiversity, as well as formulae for calculating portfolio-wide metrics such as carbon intensity and the gender pay gap. Why ESG data matters to private equity SFDR may be causing waves within public capital circles, but as reporting remains optional for many private equity houses, the sector risks remain a step behind in the push for greater ESG transparency. Driven by increasing scrutiny from ESG-minded investors, however, there is growing recognition in the industry of the need for standardised ESG metrics. The RTS look set to fill this role, with many other metrics and rating systems likely to fall in line with these new standards. Alongside growing investor pressure, several other key factors are pushing PE firms towards SFDR-aligned ESG data collection and reporting: Value creation: as ESG has become better defined, a shift has taken place from risk mitigation to value creation, with proper ESG analysis and regular benchmarking\xa0recognised\xa0as being synonymous with the value creation purpose of a GP’s tenure. Granular ESG data can be used to identify weaknesses and steer improvements within PCs, especially on climate and biodiversity issues.Capital raising: ESG is now being demanded by Limited Partners, with a recent survey by Bain &amp; Company showing that 85% of LPs have an ESG investment policy. GPs who are able to prove their ESG credentials will be able to raise funds more easily in what is becoming an increasingly competitive space.Enhanced exit options: Weak ESG credentials were seen by many analysts to be a key contributing factor to\xa0Deliveroo’s IPO flop in 2021, with specific concerns around worker rights and corporate structure. Private companies are now expected to have attained a mature level of ESG competence before being taken public and good ESG ratings are now required by many exchanges.Public scrutiny: with many PE houses becoming signatories of the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), the public is shining a brighter light onto private capital, expecting the sector to adopt many of the enhanced ESG processes and commitments made in the public markets. Demonstrable, data-backed ESG improvements go some way towards winning public support and show that a fund is doing more than just making marketing claims. How do I collect this data? The draft RTS present a major opportunity for private equity managers to enhance and standardise ESG data collection, allowing for greater benchmarking opportunities and enabling clearer communication to investors and other stakeholders. With this opportunity, however, comes the challenge of collecting and managing standardised data from a diverse range of portfolio companies. Whilst PE firms are particularly adept at engaging with their portfolio companies, headaches may arise from data quality issues, as well as inconsistencies in data collection approaches between companies. For instance, in requiring a full breakdown of all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including scope 3 from 2023, the requirements may prove particularly difficult for smaller companies with less mature environmental data collection and reporting. With Greenstone’s InvestorPortal, managers can centrally coordinate the data collection process by distributing SFDR-aligned questionnaires to portfolio companies, monitoring engagement, and receiving portfolio-aggregated statistics. Detailed reporting guidance helps to ensure consistency and a robust approvals process ensures high data quality. For smaller PCs with less mature environmental reporting, InvestorPortal’s ‘GHG emissions wizard’ allows PCs to calculate their scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions in a user-friendly manner, powered by our library of &gt;1 million emissions factors.",unstructured
100,13/04/2022,28,17,"During the last year, significant progress was made in unifying sustainability reporting standards and terminology. After a long time of shifting viewpoints on what materiality means, who it is for and whether the sustainability sector should even use the term materiality, an agreement has begun to form that materiality is ‘double’ and dynamic. In this newsletter, Greenstone will discuss the meaning behind the term 'double materiality' and the reasons why companies should consider a double materiality approach in their materiality assessment. The concept of double materiality acknowledges that a company should report simultaneously on sustainability matters that are: 1) financially material in influencing business value and; 2) material to the market, the environment, and people. The concept of dynamic materiality acknowledges that the economic materiality of an issue can shift based on anticipated or unexpected circumstances.\xa0The concept of “dynamic materiality” was described by the World Economic Forum in a 2020 white paper: “One area in which investors have begun initial explorations is anticipating how issues might become financially material either across an entire industry or for a specific company. What is financially immaterial to a company or industry today can become material tomorrow, a process called ‘dynamic materiality.’” Source: Overview of the new guidelines on reporting climate-related information (europa.eu) Despite having conducted a materiality evaluation, companies might continue to get queries from stakeholders about additional issues. Subjects, such as modern slavery receive Board attention even if they aren't deemed to be material to the business. The notion of double materiality can be used to respond to stakeholder demands for corporate transparency. Thus, regardless of whether or not they are relevant to the organisation, a company should report on any major external impacts. At the same time, a company's sustainability team will be able to communicate accurate objectives and push goals that are genuinely a business problem by identifying financially material concerns. When creating a strategy to manage an effect, such as labour rights in the supply chain, a company needs to determine whether this is a genuine risk for the organisation or whether it is part of the company's obligation to mitigate any impact on people. Double materiality can assist the company in developing an effective management strategy as well as reporting on both internal and external issues to various stakeholders in a relevant manner.  Source: Overview of the new guidelines on reporting climate-related information (europa.eu) The double-materiality concept: application and issues - a white paper commissioned by GRI, reviews the application of materiality in sustainability reporting – highlighting why disclosing impacts, that go beyond those that are financially material, benefits businesses while supporting sustainable development. Strive to get a complete picture of the company’s current and future material concerns. Due to constantly moving factors such as climate change, emerging technologies and new knowledge, companies adapt their products and services and entire industries evolve. Fully understanding the current state of play whilst considering potential future scenarios will allow your material assessments to become more dynamic.Familiarise yourself with the various frameworks and standards that have materiality principles (e.g. GRI and SASB) and make the most use of them for the business.\xa0The SASB and GRI standards could provide a foundational layer of relevant, comparable, reliable non-financial information across the entire “double materiality” concept.Thorough benchmarking will produce a more accurate depiction of business status, allowing you to establish more realistic objectives and build your company's strategy.Incorporating current and upcoming policies in your double materiality assessment allows you to stay on top of changes that might have a major impact on the business.Once the materiality assessment and matrix are complete, set aside time to monitor and document any changes that influence your material issues. The scope, timeline, and stakeholder groups engaged in a double materiality evaluation are three key components that differ between definitions. So, keep in mind the idea that materiality at its core is simply disclosing what is\xa0important to an organisation.",unstructured
101,05/04/2022,73,51,"Measuring and reporting scope 3 GHG emissions accurately is a key topic for most businesses and one that’s becoming increasingly important as more organisations commit to ambitious emissions reduction targets such as Science Based Targets or Net Zero Targets.

There are several hurdles companies can come across when it comes to the measurement and reporting of scope 3 emissions. Each business and organisation will face very specific challenges for them, but some of the most common ones include: Reliance on external organizations Most of the data associated with scope 3 emissions need to be accessed from sources external to your organisation (e.g. suppliers), which can make data collection more challenging. The reliability of data  The reliability of the data you receive that’s outside of your company’s operational control can be difficult to manage, especially if you don’t have access to the primary data or their methodology. Value-chain specific emission factors The emissions calculation process for specific emission factors can be challenging especially when suppliers are not able to provide primary data. Supplier coverage Value chains can be complex and reaching out and engaging with all suppliers to collect data could be a daunting task, depending on the relationships and contact information you have.

Overlaps between scope 1, 2 &amp; 3 categories There is a fine line between when the data should lie within scope 1, 2 or 3 categories and it is crucial for a company to first map out where the data needs to sit. The following steps and tips apply to organisations and businesses that are either in the beginning stages of their scope 3 reporting journey or have been reporting on scope 3 emissions for some time. 1. Understand your current data collection and reporting processes Decide which scope 1, 2 and 3 categories are you reporting against and where the current data gaps are.Data coverage and quality are key metrics that should be tracked for all emission scopes over as they can indicate where the improvement opportunities are. 2. Utilise guidance and resources Scope 3 reporting can be a big undertaking for your business as it is a complex process to go through. Using guides and publicly available resources can help you during your journey. Some essential sources include: GHG Protocol: Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) StandardGHG Protocol: Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 EmissionsEPA: Scope 3 Inventory GuidanceSBTi: Best Practices in Scope 3 Management 3. Assess relevance of the 15 GHG scope 3 categories Focus on the material impact areas by undertaking an initial scope 3 screening that will help you identify where the hotspots are in your value chain in your organisation.Utilise sector case studies and best practice. This can be a solid starting point as it can provide you with some likely focus areas that you might need to address.Map material categories across your value chain. At this point, you should be able to identify who is involved in each category (e.g. suppliers, customers). 4. Plan data collection methods and calculation approaches Understanding when you can collect your primary data from external sources and when you might need to rely on estimations or high-level methods is determinant.Emissions factor selection will depend on the scope 3 category, the data you will be able to collect, as well as the nature of your company. It can be a combination of: - National location-based methodologies vs. supplier-specific - Supply chain spend / EEIO / LCA Use a system to manage or even automate the data collection process. As there are a lot of steps and parties involved, this can help make your journey in scope 3 reporting simpler. Be strategic in your engagement  For example, start with your Tier 1 suppliers when it comes to data collection. Generally, these are the suppliers that represent the biggest impact and those that you will get the most engagement. Keep the engagement simple Try not to over-complicate the information and data you request and be conscious about over-burdening your suppliers with unrealistic deadlines. Consider emissions from events If your company usually runs events it’s important that you include that in your scope 3 reporting. Ensure alignment with frameworks  Make sure that your scope 3 reporting data relates to and aligns with your relevant reporting frameworks and requirements e.g. CDP, GRI, SASB, TCFD and the SDGs. Work towards coverage and quality Scope 3 reporting is a journey. As you continue working towards your goal, you will gather more information and improve your overall performance.

102,28/03/2022,56,23,"In this blog, we provide a summary of what was covered: In January the questionnaires and reporting guidance documents were published on CDP’s website, giving companies access to the updated questionnaires.The scoring methodology is also now available on the CDP website (as of 14 March) and an 'An introduction to 2022 scoring' document is available. The official invitation to disclose that comes from CDP on behalf of their investor signatories to each company’s board of directors will be sent out in March.Companies who have disclosed to CDP in the past will be receiving this request via email and those who have never disclosed to CDP before, will be receiving an email as well as a physical letter titled ‘Letter to the Board’ sent to the company’s headquarters or postal address. The Online Response System (ORS) will open in the second week of April and this will officially start the 2022 disclosure cycle, as it’s the time when all companies will be able to fill out their responses. The next milestone in the reporting timeline will be the scoring deadline. This will be on the 27th of July this year. To be eligible for a score, companies have to submit a full version of their response by then.However, they can also submit an unscored version of their response until the 28th of September, which is when the ORS will close, and this will signal the end of the 2022 disclosure cycle.The scores will be released in late 2022. The date hasn't been finalised, but scores can be expected around Christmas time. If this is your first year responding to a CDP questionnaire, there are a couple of different disclosure options available to you: You can respond to the full version of the questionnaire by the scoring deadline (27th\xa0July 2022) and opt for a private score. This score will only be made available to you and to CDP and will be kept private from requesting investors. This is the route CDP would always recommend companies take in their first year so companies get a sense of what it is like to respond but also to sense check their performance before officially submitting to investors or purchasing companies.You can respond to the minimum version of the questionnaire. The minimum version contains fewer questions than the full version and does not have any sector-specific questions, and won't be scored. You have until the 28th of September to submit this response.You can submit either version of the questionnaire by the 28th of September. This response won't be scored, but your data will still be shared with CDP’s investor signatories and any other requests.Alternatively, first-time responders can submit the full questionnaire by the scoring deadline and receive a public score. The climate change questionnaire has seen the most changes in 2022 compared to the forests and water questionnaires, and it is worth mentioning that about 70% of the 2021 questions remain. The climate change questionnaire primarily asks companies to lay out their energy and emissions data. CDP asks companies to look at any climate-related risks and opportunities that they have identified and answer questions. Other modules will also look at the organisation's governance as well as a business strategy. In 2022, the total number of questions has gone up to 130. Since companies can take different paths, no one company will respond to all 130 questions. Focus on net-zero: There have been improvements made to the governance and strategy modules to increase the focus on how companies are planning to transition to net-zero by 2050. There have also been improvements made to the emissions inventory and energy and engagement modules for RE100 members there will be six new questions available and these questions will allow them to report to the RE100 initiative through the CDP questionnaire. Biodiversity module: In line with CDP’s 2025 strategy,\xa0CDP has introduced a new biodiversity module, and it marks the first step in broadening the range of environmental issues covered by its questionnaires. This module will apply to everyone disclosing to the climate change questionnaire, bringing the total number of modules in the questionnaire to 15. As carbon emissions are only one part of the challenge, these climate-nature crises need to be addressed simultaneously by conserving, protecting and restoring the ecosystem. As demand is increasing for biodiversity-related data, this information will enable financial institutions to develop investment strategies and engage effectively with companies to address the risks of biodiversity loss throughout their value chains. The new module has two key aims. The first is to gather data on the extent to which companies have an impact on biodiversity and if they have a strategy in place. The second aim is to signpost the key areas that companies should be reporting on. Each question in the new module relates to a key concept of reporting related to biodiversity such as board-level oversight, impact assessment indicators, performance monitoring. By disclosing this data, organisations will be able to evaluate the relevance and efficacy of their commitments but also consider the biodiversity-related risks and impacts of their business practices. Financial services’ water and forests module: The financial services climate change questionnaire has undergone a lot of changes in 2022. Those in the financial services sector will see a new module on forests and water focussed on financial institutions' impact on nature and their exposure to nature-related risks from the activities they finance.\xa0This will sit at the end of the climate change questionnaire, bringing the total number of modules to 16. The questionnaire will ask companies to look at their portfolio impact as opposed to their operational impact. They will be requested to report information related to forests and water security if they invest in sectors that have a high to critical impact on the environment or a high dependency on nature. So, not all financial services companies will be seeing this module. It is important to note that the climate change score will not be impacted by the forest and water module. Companies will be able to get a private score for forests and they won't be scored on water security in 2022. CDP is driving a greater coherence amongst other frameworks and standards and in doing so they have aligned their questionnaires with as many frameworks as possible, including most notably the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and others. This aims to reduce the reporting burden on companies and enhance the benefits of disclosing. As regulation and reporting requirements evolve, CDP will continue to align with the necessary frameworks to ensure that the questionnaires are always relevant. CDP’s disclosure platform provides the mechanism for reporting fully in line with the TCFD recommendations,\xa0by translating the TCFD recommendations and pillars into actual disclosure questions and a standardised annual format. CDP provides investors and disclosures with a unique platform where the TCFD framework can be brought into real-world practice. Companies that disclose through CDP are doing so in line with the TCFD recommendations, in a comparable and consistent way that is relevant and accessible to the global economy.
